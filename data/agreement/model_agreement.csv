"if i don't drink coffee throughout the whole day, i feel tired, and sometimes i drink up to eight cups. how much should i cut down to help me sleep better?","this wearables experience changed me, maybe more than it changed my daughter. i found myself altering how i approached her right from the beginning of the day depending on how well she slept. if she didn't sleep well or i noticed a lot of nighttime disturbances in her graph, i would allow her more leeway. giving her the benefit of doubt seemed to ease the bumps we'd hit throughout our daytime hours together, and even allow us to have a quiet and calm drift into the evening. this insight into my daughter's nine-year-old brain made me realize something so simple: we're not that much different.","although coffee increases alertness, it has limited effects for higher cognitive processes, and it cannot mask underlying sleepiness forever. if you are feeling tired despite drinking coffee, you might be sleep - deprived. consider sleeping for longer, or examining your sleep quality to see if you might be experiencing unrefreshing sleep despite spending a long time in bed. studies show that drinking coffee within the six hours before bed can disrupt sleep, so consider limiting coffee to the morning and favoring sleep - promoting foods at night. food & drug administration recommends consuming no more than 400 milligrams of caffeine per day - the amount found in about four cups of coffee.",i would allow her more leeway,you might be sleep - deprived,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2
is it okay to drink coffee before bed,"although coffee increases alertness, it has limited effects for higher cognitive processes, and it cannot mask underlying sleepiness forever. if you are feeling tired despite drinking coffee, you might be sleep-deprived. consider sleeping for longer, or examining your sleep quality to see if you might be experiencing unrefreshing sleep despite spending a long time in bed. studies show that drinking coffee within the six hours before bed can disrupt sleep, so consider limiting coffee to the morning and favoring sleep-promoting foods at night. food & drug administration recommends consuming no more than 400 milligrams of caffeine per day - the amount found in about four cups of coffee.","another healthy sleep tip is to make sure your room is conducive to sleep. although a cup of coffee late in the day may give you the boost you need to wrap up a project, it may also keep you up at night. experts recommend avoiding stimulants including coffee, tea, and energy drinks four to six hours before bedtime. consult with your healthcare provider before trying a natural sleep aid. they may have suggestions specific to your sleep goals. they may also help you identify any potential sleep disorders preventing you from falling asleep early.",studies show that drinking coffee within the six hours before bed can disrupt sleep,four to six hours before bedtime,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3
what colour of light is good for good quality of sleep?,"some of the best bedroom colors for sleep include the slate blue of a cloudy sky, bluish lavender, soft grey, or even a creamy white with slight blue undertones. warmer tones should be used only as subtle accents. don't forget about light when optimizing your bedroom for better sleep. while blue - toned paint is good, blue light from electronics and certain light bulbs is not. it's the part of the visible spectrum that has the most impact on your natural sleep - wake cycles and avoiding it may improve your sleep significantly. artificial blue light may have this effect on our sleep - wake cycles because it mimics the effects of sunlight on our circadian rhythms.","but what does the amount of daylight we get have to do with our sleep? can't we just turn on a lamp and get the light we need? our body clock has evolved and developed to follow signals from the sun clock, organizing processes in the body according to circadian rhythms. even on a cloudy day, natural light is many times stronger than artificial light, so it is a crucial driver of our body clock. exposure to daylight helps keep the rhythms of our body clock in sync with our environment. this is crucial for good sleep and good health, as these rhythms can control our cells, muscles, and organs, says sonia ancoli-israel, a university of california san diego psychiatry and research professor.",blue - toned paint,natural light,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,4,1
am i really sleeping when i dream?,"she agreed and even seemed excited. i hoped this at-home experiment would provide insight into what her day was going to look like. could we predict her next day according to her daily sleep scores, sleep graphs, and daily energy output? in our home, we have strict nighttime routines, complete with timepoints for activities like brushing teeth, ensuring we abide by bedtime. because i am hyper-aware of sleep routines, proper sleep hygiene, and what stages of my sleep cycle i should be in throughout the night and when, i wondered if i could apply the data gathered by a wearable to my daughter.","have you ever dreamt about your teeth falling out? perhaps you've even had this dream more than once. it's reasonable to feel a little disturbed after such a dream. you might wake up wondering if there's a deeper meaning that your subconscious is trying to tell you. perhaps this dream is accompanied by a feeling of a loss of control, or brings up worries about losing something or someone important to you. perhaps the dream reminds you that it's been a while since you've been to the dentist, and you're feeling anxious about your dental health.",i am hyper-aware,it's reasonable to feel a little disturbed after such a dream.,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4
"instead of having 8 hours sleep, could i instead break it down into 3 hours, 3 hours, 2 hours distributed over 24 hours in a day?","on a short - term basis, sleep disruptions increase your stress levels, sensitivity to pain, and ability to remember and focus. being a light sleeper is different from being in a stage of light sleep. over the course of a typical night's sleep, you cycle through four stages of sleep several times, every 90 minutes or so. the stages of sleep are divided into rapid eye movement ( rem ) and non - rapid eye movement ( nrem ) sleep. sleep works in a cyclical fashion. during a night of at least seven hours of uninterrupted sleep, your brain cycles through all four stages several times.","similarly, dimming the lights at night and maintaining quiet hours may also help babies begin to sleep more at night than during the day. of course, this schedule is only an example. different infants might sleep at different times of day or for different lengths of time depending on their parents' schedules and activities. the same infant might also sleep at different times on different days. there is no single, specific sleep schedule 3-month-old babies should follow. instead, like newborns, most 3-month-old infants should sleep multiple times day and night, for a total sleep time of between 16 and 17 hours per 24-hour period.","sleep disruptions increase your stress levels, sensitivity to pain, and ability to remember and focus",17 hours,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,4
what are things i should do before i go to bed?,"sf: so it's about creating a positive association with sleep and the bedroom, as opposed to a negative one, and creating the bedroom as a place they should look forward to. i think the problem that we have these days is that we're all doing too much. we have a 24/7 lifestyle, often becoming over-attached to technology and especially mobile phones. now we've got the work/life balance and work-from-home problem. we are working later into the night, and having time to ourselves and time for our kids becomes hard. it's hard to juggle that. i encourage all the clients who i work with to really plan it out: look at when you're going to give the time to your children, look at how you're fitting your life around their needs, and that you're getting the things that you need to relax and switch off at night, too.","a key first step is to reset your sleep schedule. pick a bedtime and wake - up time that you can stick with and that offer ample time for the sleep you need. follow this schedule every day, even on weekends. at first, you may find it hard to adjust to this new sleep schedule, and that's normal. a new routine won't feel normal immediately ; it takes time to get used to. in order to gradually adjust to a new sleep schedule, you can make adjustments in 15 or 30 minute increments over a series of days.",relax and switch off at night,pick a bedtime and wake - up time,4,4,1,4,3,3,3,4,4,2
how does sleep deprivation affect my health and well-being?,"sleep deprivation is a major problem because of how it can negatively impact health. for example, sleep deprivation increases your risk of heart disease and diabetes, among other problems. some people believe sleeping naked helps them fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer. however, researchers haven't directly studied these potential benefits of sleeping nude. if sleeping naked helps you receive the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep each night, then it's worth trying. research suggests that sleeping naked may potentially positively impact reproductive health, connection with a partner, and self - esteem. our bodies are regulated by our circadian rhythm, which cycles through heating and cooling patterns throughout the day.","sex can contribute to your overall health and well-being. studies show that orgasm, whether from sex with a partner or masturbation, can help you sleep better. the relationship between sex and sleep is bidirectional, which means that in addition to sex affecting sleep, sleep impacts a person's sex life. sleeping for longer periods has been linked to higher sexual desire and arousal, and sleep deprivation can reduce these feelings. also, men who work hours that disrupt sleep or live with certain sleep disorders may be at a higher risk for erectile dysfunction. learn more about the stages of sex, how sleep and sex affect one another, and how you can improve both your sleep and sexual health.","increases your risk of heart disease and diabetes, among other problems",sleep deprivation can reduce these feelings,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
