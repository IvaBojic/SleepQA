        "text": "cbt-i is considered effective with many types of insomnia, even showing potential benefits for people with short-term insomnia. this means that cbt-i may be useful in treating insomnia symptoms even when they don't meet the criteria for chronic insomnia. while this treatment has demonstrated impressive efficacy in treating insomnia, it doesn't always work right away. it can take time to learn and practice the skills learned in treatment. some techniques, like stimulus control and sleep restriction, often help to adjust sleep habits slowly. some people find it helpful to track their progress over time in order to see small improvements that can encourage them to continue treatment."

        "text": "dopamine agonists can be taken in pill form approximately two hours before bedtime or administered continuously through a patch. the fda has currently approved three dopamine agonists for rls: pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine. a major side effect of dopaminergic drugs is augmentation (progressive worsening) of rls symptoms, which can come in many forms. symptoms may appear earlier in the day, they may become more intense, they may spread to other parts of the body, or higher doses of the drug may be needed for it to remain effective. these side effects could be mistaken for a natural progression of rls, but they are typically reversed once the patient stops using the drug."
