i play mahjong with my friends in hall very often and it messed up my sleep cycle alot, what should i do?	i was never told that sleep was important, was never encouraged to do it, and i was never educated on it. in fact, if i had behaved properly and if i'd have done well at school, i could stay up late at night to watch the midweek sport, so i was getting rewarded for losing sleep. and by the time i got to my teenage years, i was allowed to play in a band midweek until midnight. my dad was a former semi-pro musician, so i was encouraged to follow that, and i'd be the kid at the back of the class falling asleep.	play in a band
what are the advantages of sleep?	researchers also instructed them to hold an object and to report on their thoughts just before dropping the object, if they did so. during the second test after the break, some participants had what the researchers called a eureka moment and found a way to solve the problems faster and more accurately. participants who had reached only the first stage of sleep seemed to have a creative advantage: more than three-quarters (83%) of these participants discovered the shortcut to solving the math problems. only 30% of the participants who did not sleep identified the shortcut, and 14% of participants who slept more deeply discovered it.	creative advantage
what should i eat to get better sleep?	i can't imagine why that's not common practice in all universities. it should be absolutely spoon fed to children and university graduates, because it's a no-brainer. it's now proven that children who get better sleep get better results in exams. i approach health from all different angles, so i get people coming to me either for a specific health need or a global intervention. and it's interesting when you look at the things that are components of health. you can't get away from exercise, sleep, and food. and they all crossover and interconnect. when you look at the rise in obesity and the decrease in sleep, they're pretty much interlinked, too.	spoon fed
what kinds of sleep disorders are there?	tell them what kind of sleep issues you've been having, when they started, and how frequently you experience them. this information can help them prescribe an appropriate treatment plan to relieve your sleep issues. if your doctor recommends a sleep aid, always read the sleeping pill's medication guide to make sure you fully understand the risks and potential side effects. only take it as prescribed by your doctor, and only when you have time to get a full night's sleep to minimize side effects the next day. if you're consistently having trouble falling or staying asleep, talk to your doctor. behavior and lifestyle changes, in addition to cognitive behavioral therapy, can help. if an underlying issue is behind insomnia, be it a health condition or a sleep disorder, treating that can resolve or improve your insomnia.	insomnia
how do i prolong rem sleep?	while our family chose the amazon halo for our experiment, there are numerous sleep trackers available that are appropriate for kids, such as the garmin vivofit jr. 2 and fitbit ace 2 and 3. the data these trackers provide can offer a new perspective on your child's daily and nightly routines and sleep quality. do i vote for every child being constantly analyzed for data? certainly not. you have to do what makes you and your family comfortable. wearables can be a gentle, fun, non-invasive way of gaining insight into your child's inner workings. and, hey, now my daughter wakes up every morning and asks, can i check my sleep score?. how much sleep do babies and kids need? do your children get enough sleep? is your child getting enough sleep? here's how to tell.	can i check my sleep score
is it bad to sleep on a full stomach? what about an empty stomach?	not only is side sleeping preferred by 60% of adults, but it is also considered to be one of the healthiest sleep positions. side sleeping offers many benefits, from improved spinal alignment to a reduced risk of snoring, heartburn, and back pain. to unlock the full potential of these benefits, however, you need to get into just the right position. learn more about how to sleep on your side, which side you should choose, and what else to consider. many people live with chronic pain, especially in their lower back. sleeping in the wrong position, such as on your stomach, can increase the amount of pressure on your spine and lead to pain upon waking.	can increase the amount of pressure on your spine and lead to pain upon waking
does mood or emotions affect sleep quality?	sleep is essential to the well-being of children. not only does sleep support the overall health of the child, but it also affects a child's mood and his or her ability to learn during the daytime. a lack of sleep can have long-term impacts on a child's future academic performance and emotional health. as infants and children grow, the amount of daily sleep they need decreases. these sleep needs are initially distributed between naps and nighttime sleep, but at what age should kids stop napping? the exact age varies among children, depending on factors such as attending preschool, maturity, and nighttime sleep habits.	it also affects a child's mood
what is the cause of snoring?	almost everyone snores occasionally. habitual snoring occurs in around 40% of adult women and 57% of adult men, and some people snore regularly without any other sleep-related symptoms. however, snoring can be caused by a sleep disorder called sleep apnea, which disrupts sleep and can lead to other health issues. snoring may also be the result of a person's natural anatomy and weight, or behaviors such as drinking alcohol or sleeping in a certain position. understanding the varied causes of snoring can help you determine whether your snoring is something you should be concerned about, and what steps you can take to address it.	sleep apnea
i always wake up in the middle of the night feeling breathless, what is wrong with me?	so even if you think, my child has narcolepsy. i read this book that chris wrote, and by god, i need help. even if you're wrong, at least you're arming yourself with the understanding that the behavior that you witnessed when you were spending the night in a hotel room with your kid at the soccer tournament, and he kicked violently all through the night, is not normal. so it's okay for you to seek more information and understanding about sleepwalking, the crazy teeth grinding, the unusual vocalizations and screaming that happen at night. the same mentor who told me 99% of sleep problems are parent sleep problems, would always tell parents to never watch their kids sleep.	is not normal
is it okay to catch up on sleep debt over the weekends?	the size of your sleep debt determines how long it takes you to catch up on sleep. many people accumulate such a large sleep debt during the week that they would practically have to sleep all weekend to pay it back. when we fail to fully make up our sleep debt over the weekend, it carries over into the next workweek. interestingly, many people report feeling completely fine after a weekend of catching up on sleep, even though their bodies show markers of increased stress. researchers suggest that the lack of discomfort we feel after receiving catch-up sleep might explain why we keep relying on this age-old method despite its drawbacks.	when we fail to fully make up our sleep debt over the weekend
are there any types of food that can help improve quality of sleep?	some studies have found that eating too close to bedtime can lead to weight gain, though a more important factor seems to be the type of food you eat. if you feel compelled to indulge in a midnight snack, stay away from junk food, and opt for a light and healthy snack instead. as a bonus, a healthier diet, in turn, improves sleep quality. regular exercise and a healthy diet can help you regularize your sleep schedule, improve your muscle-to-fat ratio, and boost your metabolism. avoid drinking caffeine and alcohol before bed. while caffeine does cause a temporary spike in metabolism, it interferes with sleep and is not an effective weight-loss strategy.	regular exercise and a healthy diet
i have read online that different colour coding of the bedroom can have different effects on sleep quality. is this true?	heavy drinking means more than 15 drinks per week for men and more than eight drinks per week for women. will a small amount of alcohol affect my sleep? drinking to excess will probably have a more negative impact on sleep than light or moderate alcohol consumption. however, since the effects of alcohol are different from person to person, even small amounts of alcohol can reduce sleep quality for some people. one 2018 study compared sleep quality among subjects who consumed different amounts of alcohol. when should i stop drinking prior to bed to minimize sleep disruption? to reduce the risk of sleep disruptions, you should stop drinking alcohol at least four hours before bedtime.	even small amounts of alcohol can reduce sleep quality
what is the recommended duration of an effective nap?	the amount of sleep recommended for a child depends on their age. unlike infants, preschool and school-age children follow a sleep schedule that involves getting most of their sleep at night and progressively less sleep from naps as they grow older. that said, the total amount of sleep recommended for kids, particularly those 5 years and younger, includes sleep from daytime naps. it is important to remember that exact sleep needs may depend on the individual. research shows that average sleep durations vary across cultures. individual children might also require different amounts of sleep on different nights depending on factors like exercise, diet, and light exposure.	daytime
how do substances like nicotine affect my sleep?	nicotine, alcohol, and caffeine can disturb your ability to fall and remain asleep. though it may seem like alcohol can help you sleep at night, research suggests that the substance disturbs sleepers later in the night. when you are ready for bed, ensure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and comfortably cool. if you are unable to sleep after half an hour, leave the bedroom and do a calming activity in low light until you feel sleepy again.	disturbs sleepers later in the night
i get hungry at night even if i have had a full dinner, so i sometimes eat chips before i go to bed. i read that eating before going to bed is bad for my sleep, so should i just go to bed hungry?	i was never told that sleep was important, was never encouraged to do it, and i was never educated on it. in fact, if i had behaved properly and if i'd have done well at school, i could stay up late at night to watch the midweek sport, so i was getting rewarded for losing sleep. and by the time i got to my teenage years, i was allowed to play in a band midweek until midnight. my dad was a former semi-pro musician, so i was encouraged to follow that, and i'd be the kid at the back of the class falling asleep.	i could stay up late at night to watch the midweek sport
how do i know if i am in need of professional sleep therapy?	cbt-i is often provided by a doctor, counselor, therapist, or psychiatrist trained in this form of treatment. practitioners with experience in cbt-i can be found through professional organizations such as the society of behavioral sleep medicine and the american board of sleep medicine. unfortunately, due to the widespread need for this treatment, there aren't enough cbt-i professionals to meet the current demand. in response, researchers have developed new ways of offering cbt-i, such as digital, group, and self-help formats. several digital cbt-i (sometimes called dcbt-i or dcbt) applications have been developed in order to adapt to this trend, reduce the cost of treatment, and offer the benefits of cbt-i to a wider audience.	practitioners with experience in cbt-i can be found through professional organizations
do we sleep better after exhausting our body more?	sleep deprivation can leave you feeling tired, less creative, and make it more difficult to stay focused on important projects. sacrificing sleep for work, then working more to make up for lost productivity can become an exhausting cycle. fortunately, understanding the links between sleep and job performance can empower people with the knowledge needed to end this pattern. creating a boundary between work and home life can be challenging in the beginning, but it's an important step towards both better sleep and more consistent job performance. sleep supports nearly every system in the body. when we fall asleep, our eyes close, our breathing slows, and our muscles gradually relax.	our eyes close, our breathing slows, and our muscles gradually relax.
when should i avoid exercise for better sleep?	i can't imagine why that's not common practice in all universities. it should be absolutely spoon fed to children and university graduates, because it's a no-brainer. it's now proven that children who get better sleep get better results in exams. i approach health from all different angles, so i get people coming to me either for a specific health need or a global intervention. and it's interesting when you look at the things that are components of health. you can't get away from exercise, sleep, and food. and they all crossover and interconnect. when you look at the rise in obesity and the decrease in sleep, they're pretty much interlinked, too.	rise in obesity and the decrease in sleep
does weight affect sleep quality?	conventional wisdom used to be that one's weight is determined purely by nutrition and activity level. however, we now understand body weight to be more than simply a function of behavior. genetics, socioeconomic status, community environment, stress, and overall health all play a role in one's weight. additionally, how well or poorly you sleep can affect weight gain and loss, as sleep loss is one of the risk factors for obesity. a troubling concern for individuals with obesity is that not only does sleep loss lead to weight gain, but being overweight also causes sleep issues, which can, in turn, worsen biological processes that contribute to weight gain.	how well or poorly
i grind my teeth during my sleep, why is that so?	so even if you think, my child has narcolepsy. i read this book that chris wrote, and by god, i need help. even if you're wrong, at least you're arming yourself with the understanding that the behavior that you witnessed when you were spending the night in a hotel room with your kid at the soccer tournament, and he kicked violently all through the night, is not normal. so it's okay for you to seek more information and understanding about sleepwalking, the crazy teeth grinding, the unusual vocalizations and screaming that happen at night. the same mentor who told me 99% of sleep problems are parent sleep problems, would always tell parents to never watch their kids sleep.	okay for you to seek more information and understanding about sleepwalking
how does sleep improve my short-term and long-term memory?	more than 50% of americans report suffering from sleep problems, yet two-thirds of these individuals do not qualify for a diagnosis of insomnia. sleep loss can contribute to a variety of short-term and long-term consequences, including higher stress levels, increased sensitivity to pain, mood disorders, memory and performance problems, and chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease. for most people, correcting poor sleep hygiene is the simplest way to start improving sleep. sleep hygiene principles are generally low-risk and inexpensive, and they are easy to adopt without needing to consult a doctor. the first step to improving sleep hygiene involves teaching your brain to associate the bedroom with sleep.	correcting poor sleep hygiene
what type of yoga should i do before sleeping?	such exercise, when done at least several hours before bedtime, can help you sleep better at night. since high-activity yoga forms elevate the heart rate, it's best to avoid these practices right before bedtime. poses done before bedtime should encourage the body to relax and sleep. keep in mind that the sleep environment should primarily be used for sleeping; find another quiet location to do your yoga poses before you go to sleep. be sure you are in a safe space free of any potential hazards. if you have any concerns about your yoga practice, consult a yoga instructor and/or a physician. remember that yoga is not a substitute for medical treatment. in the event of persistent sleep disturbances or other concerns, consult your physician to develop a treatment plan.	high-activity yoga
what really happens if i dont get the optimum number of sleep for a university student?	what is a bad sleeper? and how much of that is something that's artificially constructed in our mind versus somebody who truly has a sleep problem? so yeah, i think that parents play a big role in these types of things. left to their own devices and with a little bit of help, parents can learn to really guide their kids into better sleep patterns and recognize problems when they exist. on what he tells new parents. number one, your child sleeps, it's impossible not to. now, what might be happening is that your child is not sleeping in a way that's predictable and efficient.	your child is not sleeping in a way that's predictable and efficient
what are good sleep hygiene?	this hormone helps children grow and repairs cells and tissues in both children and adults. additionally, a good night's sleep helps the immune system defend against infections, which may explain why getting plenty of sleep keeps you healthy and also allows you to recover if you do become ill. the good news is that you can promote better sleep by creating a constructive bedtime routine and establishing excellent sleep hygiene. there's a lot of information about what to do before bedtime to get a good night's rest, but it's equally important to know what not to do.	creating a constructive bedtime routine
does the type or quality of mattress matter in obtaining a better sleeping experience?	if you would like to remember more of your dreams, it may help to write them down in a dream journal the moment you wake up. both mattress cost and type can matter when it comes to comfort. a high-quality mattress generally costs between $600 and $2,000. mattresses that are significantly less expensive are more likely to be made from lower-quality materials or poorly constructed. mattresses that are more expensive may have extra features and designer elements that do not necessarily translate to better sleep. the best type of mattress for you is whichever one allows you to sleep soundly at night.	whichever one allows you to sleep soundly at night.
does exercise help me sleep better?	when you feel tired, a good night's sleep can usually help you feel refreshed. in contrast, fatigue is a prolonged feeling of tiredness and lack of energy that typically isn't resolved by sleeping. as much as 50% of the people report symptoms of fatigue at some point. fatigue is common after sleep deprivation, long periods of stress, and physical activity. however, fatigue can also be a symptom of an underlying health concern. me/cfs is a common cause of chronic fatigue. people with chronic fatigue syndrome experience persistent fatigue lasting longer than six months that does not get better with rest.	a good night's sleep can usually help you feel refreshed
what are the sleep stage	during a normal sleep period, you progress through four to five sleep cycles. each sleep cycle is made up of four individual sleep stages. the four stages of sleep are further broken down into two categories: rapid eye movement (rem) and non-rem sleep. these categories are important because what happens during rem sleep is dramatically different from what happens during non-rem stages. the first three stages of sleep are composed of non-rem activity. stage 1 is short, representing the act of dozing off and transitioning into sleep. in stage 2 the body and mind slow down as you settle into sleep.	rapid eye movement (rem) and non-rem sleep
can i take multiple naps rather than sleeping through the night?	babies aged 4 to 12 months require 12 to 16 hours of sleep, but much of this sleep is obtained during short daytime and nighttime naps. understandably, many new parents look forward to the day when their baby starts sleeping through the night. we discuss why babies wake up at night and how to help your baby sleep through the night when the time is right. while babies need more sleep than adults, they sleep in multiple shorter periods throughout the day and night. a baby's sleep-wake rhythm does not start to stabilize in line with day and night until the age of 10 to 12 weeks, although some babies may take longer than others.	they sleep in multiple shorter periods
how do i get better sleep being a night owl?	and i think the problem that we've got is, how do you cope with that body clock shift? you can't. you can't get a teenager to go to bed at 9:00. it's just not physically possible, because the melatonin isn't being secreted then. so then you look at the weekend. should you let them catch up on sleep? yes. how much? maximum two hours. does that mean they've got a sleep debt? yes, if they've knocked two hours off their recommended sleep each school night - which a lot of teenagers do - teenagers should be sleeping between eight to ten hours each night.	maximum two hours

how do i encourage other people in my family to sleep better?	while our family chose the amazon halo for our experiment, there are numerous sleep trackers available that are appropriate for kids, such as the garmin vivofit jr. 2 and fitbit ace 2 and 3. the data these trackers provide can offer a new perspective on your child's daily and nightly routines and sleep quality. do i vote for every child being constantly analyzed for data? certainly not. you have to do what makes you and your family comfortable. wearables can be a gentle, fun, non-invasive way of gaining insight into your child's inner workings. and, hey, now my daughter wakes up every morning and asks, can i check my sleep score?. how much sleep do babies and kids need? do your children get enough sleep? is your child getting enough sleep? here's how to tell.	you have to do what makes you and your family comfortable
why do we need to sleep?	rem sleep, through its activation of our central nervous system, might help us get ready to wake back up. this may explain why we spend increasing amounts of time in rem sleep as the night progresses and why we are easier to wake up during this stage. we need the most rem sleep as infants and children, when our brains are still developing. newborn babies spend eight hours in rem sleep each day. by adulthood, we only need an average of two hours of rem sleep each night. different species require different amounts of rem sleep.	when our brains are still developing
i often fall asleep at an inappropriate time, e.g. when attending lessons or meeting. it's embarrassing but how to solve this problem?	do you notice yourself feeling tired all the time, or sometimes falling asleep during the daytime when you'd prefer to be awake? excessive daytime sleepiness, also called drowsiness, can majorly interfere with your life. when you feel excessively sleepy, you might doze off at inappropriate times. for example, you could find yourself falling asleep during a work meeting or while driving. as a result, excessive sleepiness can create personal problems or even become dangerous. excessive sleepiness is generally considered a symptom or side effect rather than a primary disorder. most people who have excessive sleepiness also have an underlying issue causing their drowsiness, even if they aren't aware of it.	work meeting or while driving
how can i prevent having nightmares?	many psychotherapies for nightmares involve a combination of methods. examples include cbt-i, sleep dynamic therapy and exposure, relaxation, and rescripting therapy (errt). mental health professionals can tailor talk therapy for nightmares to fit a patient, including, when appropriate, account for a coexisting mental health disorder. several types of prescription medications may be used to treat nightmare disorder. most often, these are medications that affect the nervous system such as anti-anxiety, antidepressant, or antipsychotic drugs. different medications may be used for people who have nightmares associated with ptsd. medications benefit some patients, but they can also come with side effects.	mental health professionals can tailor talk therapy
does more dream mean worse sleep?	children are less likely to have positive recurring dreams, though they have significantly more recurring dreams that inspire a neutral emotional response. the idea that dreams have hidden meanings in their content was a popular component of freudian dream theory. but, there is little evidence to support the idea that dreams with the same content or themes have the same meaning for everyone. however, examining what your dreams mean to you personally can still be meaningful, particularly in a therapeutic context. experiencing recurring dreams may point at underlying issues regardless of the dream's content. adults who experience frequent recurring dreams tend to have worse psychological health than those who do not, and many experts theorize that these dreams may be a way to work through unmet needs or process trauma.	adults who experience frequent recurring dreams tend to have worse psychological health
what is the ideal time for me to sleep and wake up for my age?	when i'm not rested, i'm grumpy, crabby, and generally unpleasant. and, like her mom, my little girl is, too - but i had lost sight of that before a wearable helped me remember. although we received a lot of new information from the wearable, we did not change much in my daughter's schedule - no cancelled weekend movie nights in favor of sleep on the weekends, for sure. she needs to be a kid and have those cheating-the-system moments! what this experiment really helped me understand, however, is how significantly sleep impacts her every day. it also taught me how to approach her during an off-day.	weekends
how many hours of sleep should an adult get?	although sleep needs vary among children, the national sleep foundation provides guidelines for how many hours babies and toddlers should sleep during each 24-hour period. if you are concerned that your baby sleeps too much or too little, contact your pediatrician. expert guidelines outline how much babies should sleep during both day and night. for this reason, how much a baby should nap largely depends on how much they sleep at night. babies should nap as many hours as needed to get sufficient sleep in a 24-hour period. for example, guidelines recommend that 6-month-olds should sleep 12 to 16 hours a day, so if they sleep eight hours at night, they should nap around four to eight hours during the day.	12 to 16 hours a day, so if they sleep eight
how do weighted blankets affect my sleep?	choosing the right bedding may seem straightforward, but the process can be quite challenging. a wide range of sheets, blankets, comforters, and duvets are available to today's consumers. selecting each component may require a fair amount of research and comparison-shopping on your part. factors to consider include material, weave, warmth, and ease of care - not to mention price. these guides from our team of sleep product experts are intended to help you find the best bedding and enjoy these products for years to come. we'll help you understand terms like thread count and pocket depth, discuss cleaning and storage methods for different materials, and provide realistic expectations for how much new bedding items will cost. we'll also answer common questions like, what's the difference between a comforter and a duvet? or how much should my weighted blanket weigh?.	how much should my weighted blanket weigh?.
what kind of tea is good to have a good quality of sleep?	if you stick to healthy, nutrient-rich foods, you'll find it easier to stick to your intermittent fasting schedule. opt for whole foods, fruits, vegetables, and healthy proteins and fats. as a bonus, the foods that are good for your diet are good for your sleep, too. as with any change in routine, it takes a few days to adjust to intermittent fasting. allow yourself some flexibility as you figure out a schedule that works for you. fasting for eight hours might be easier than 12, or you may prefer to lower your caloric intake a few days of the week. be kind to yourself and do what works for you. by eating on a regular schedule, you may find yourself sleeping on a regular schedule more easily. consult your doctor before beginning an intermittent fasting practice, especially if you are pregnant or have a health condition.	foods that are good for your diet

can i make up sleep?	using the amazon halo made it overwhelmingly obvious that bedtime was not something to be flimsy about. weekend movie nights, which lead to later bedtimes, cemented what i had suspected the entire time: less sleep makes for a discombobulated next day. as a grown-up, i sometimes find it hard to remember what it was like being a kid. adults can often have difficulty sympathizing with children because we perceive their problems as trivial compared with the problems we face. too frequently, i am guilty of forgetting that children's gripes are a big deal to them, even though they seem easy to solve for me.	less sleep makes for a discombobulated next day
can i ever pay off my sleep debt	using a wearable can help us pay attention and make small adjustments to daily practices, like sticking to a bedtime routine. these adjustments can enormously impact our moods, attitudes, and cognitive function. using a wearable has helped me gain insight into and improve my sleep routines. my experience prompted me to wonder, if sleep-tracking wearables help adults make positive lifestyle adjustments, would sleep tracking be beneficial for children, too? as the editor-in-chief of sleep foundation, i eat, breathe, and sleep sleep! for this reason, i felt excited to see how a sleep-tracking wearable might impact my nine-year-old daughter.	using a wearable has helped me gain insight into and improve my sleep routines
what is the best environmental temperature for sleep?	chronotype is the natural inclination of your body to sleep at a certain time, or what most people understand as being an early bird versus a night owl. in addition to regulating sleep and wake times, chronotype has an influence on appetite, exercise, and core body temperature. it is responsible for the fact that you feel more alert at certain periods of the day and sleepier at others. sleep chronotype is closely related to circadian rhythm, which controls the day-to-day sleep-wake cycle and releases melatonin in response to environmental cues such as light and temperature. however, while circadian rhythm can be trained by adhering to a strict schedule, the underlying chronotype exists on a more permanent basis.	light
how important is sleep duration in contributing to sleep quality?	when thinking about getting the sleep you need, it's normal to focus on how many hours of sleep you get. while sleep duration is undoubtedly important, it's not the only part of the equation. it's also critical to think about sleep quality and whether the time spent sleeping is actually restorative. progressing smoothly multiple times through the sleep cycle, composed of four separate sleep stages, is a vital part of getting truly high-quality rest. each sleep stage plays a part in allowing your mind and body to wake up refreshed. understanding the sleep cycle also helps explain how certain sleep disorders, including insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea can impact a person's sleep and health.	undoubtedly

what kind of sleep hygiene is best to have for a university student?	improving sleep hygiene can help students of all ages get more quality sleep and perform their best at school. establishing healthy sleep habits at an early age may help preschool and school-age children thrive at school. these habits help make sleep a priority and promote quality rest. older students typically have established beliefs about sleep and existing bedtime habits. in these age groups, it is common for social engagements, school, sports, electronic devices, and other distractions to crowd out time for sleep. older students can take additional measures to cultivate good sleep hygiene.	improving
how to prevent snoring?	it is most often considered for children with severe sleep apnea, but it may be an option for some with primary snoring. by eliminating the tissue that most frequently blocks the airway, this surgery can reduce snoring and pauses in breathing at night. a positive airway pressure (pap) device channels pressurized air through a mask and into the mouth and airway to prevent obstruction. most pap devices are either continuous (cpap) or bi-level (bipap) based on how they control the flow of air. while pap devices are common for treating osa in adults, in children they are usually reserved for osa that persists after surgery to remove the tonsils and adenoids.	eliminating the tissue that most frequently blocks the airway

how much minimal duration of sleep do i need a day to function normally?	sf: so it's about creating a positive association with sleep and the bedroom, as opposed to a negative one, and creating the bedroom as a place they should look forward to. i think the problem that we have these days is that we're all doing too much. we have a 24/7 lifestyle, often becoming over-attached to technology and especially mobile phones. now we've got the work/life balance and work-from-home problem. we are working later into the night, and having time to ourselves and time for our kids becomes hard. it's hard to juggle that. i encourage all the clients who i work with to really plan it out: look at when you're going to give the time to your children, look at how you're fitting your life around their needs, and that you're getting the things that you need to relax and switch off at night, too.	24/7
why do i snore so much and wake up multiple times feeling breathless?	you might wonder, why do i keep waking up at 4 a.m.? waking up during the night is fairly common, with over 35% of people waking up during the night at least three times per week. environmental factors, such as a partner snoring, a change in the room temperature or a loud car driving by, may wake you up momentarily from sleep. usually, most people fall back asleep easily. if you are waking up at the same time each night or waking up frequently throughout the night and struggling with falling back asleep, it could be due to factors beyond your environment.	environmental factors
do blue-light glasses really work in helping improve my sleep?	the most effective way to reduce exposure to blue light in the evening is to simply turn off the sources. this means dimming or reducing led and fluorescent lighting and turning off electronic devices after it gets dark outside. specialty glasses may also be helpful in reducing exposure to blue light. while they may not work for everyone, blue-light-blocking or amber glasses can reduce the melatonin-suppressing effects of bright light. since many people can't simply turn off sources of blue light after it gets dark, here are a few other ideas to reduce blue light exposure that may be interfering with your sleep.	reduce blue light exposure that may be interfering
will drinking coffee affect my sleep?	sleep deprivation, caffeine tolerance, dehydration, adenosine levels, blood sugar changes, or individual differences in caffeine metabolism may cause you to feel tired after drinking coffee. more than one-third of americans are sleep-deprived and not receiving the recommended minimum of seven hours of sleep per night. although coffee can provide a quick pick-me-up, it is not an adequate substitute for sleep. sleep deprivation can reduce alertness, slow down response times, and negatively affect thinking. drinking more coffee in an effort to overcome tiredness might backfire. ingesting too much caffeine can negatively impact sleep, making you sleepy the next day.	might backfire
can i eat heavy meals like rice and meat before going to bed?	if you frequently find yourself waking up to go to the washroom, you may also choose to drink less fluids overall before bed. a recent study found that eating within three hours of bedtime may lead to more nighttime awakenings. eating a heavy meal right before lying down can also cause heartburn, with accompanying discomfort that may make it even more difficult to sleep. if you suffer from heartburn, try to avoid fried, spicy, or acidic foods close to bedtime. for those who have trouble sleeping through the night on an empty stomach, the best option is to enjoy a small, nutritious bedtime snack.	eating a heavy meal right before lying down can also cause heartburn
should i take melatonin every day before i sleep?	tracking my own sleep and movement is incredibly helpful in informing my day's activities. for example, i use data from my wearable to determine if i should push a little harder during my daily workout, or if i need to take it easier. plus, i truly appreciate the reminder to start winding down for sleep. i wondered if my daughter's experience would be the same. my daughter is like a typical nine-year-old, but with more energy. she's bright and bubbly some days, crabby and moody others, i asked if she thought it'd be fun if we strapped a wearable to her wrist 24/7.	easier
how does alochol and smoking affect my sleeping behaviour?	it's out in the open your hamstring hurts, let's talk about it so we can figure out we need to do something. but we don't sometimes talk about sleep in meaningful ways. so my hope is this book creates a conversation about it, because i don't think we can talk about it too much. and so when you're out with your friends, and you're talking about, my kid does this in his sleep and i read something about that one time, my hope is that this gets people talking, and moving in directions of finding that solution.	my kid does this in his sleep
why does alcohol change my sleep pattern?	these disorders, he argues, could lie at the root of issues like poor performance in school, difficult behaviors, or trouble focusing. in our interview below, we discuss newborns' sleep patterns, the growing numbers of sleep disorders in children, and why no one should be diagnosed with adhd without first having a sleep evaluation. the conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. on why he wrote the rested child. i felt like if you were to walk up to people and say, kids sleep book, they would say, oh i read a couple of them when my wife was pregnant.	no one should be diagnosed with adhd without first having a sleep evaluation
how do i prevent myself from waking up too much in the night?	this wearables experience changed me, maybe more than it changed my daughter. i found myself altering how i approached her right from the beginning of the day depending on how well she slept. if she didn't sleep well or i noticed a lot of nighttime disturbances in her graph, i would allow her more leeway. giving her the benefit of doubt seemed to ease the bumps we'd hit throughout our daytime hours together, and even allow us to have a quiet and calm drift into the evening. this insight into my daughter's nine-year-old brain made me realize something so simple: we're not that much different.	how well she slept
how useful is a smart alarm	you may also want to consider a musical alarm. many people opt for a blaring, intense alarm sound to jolt themselves awake, but research suggests a pleasant melody may be more effective. people who choose melodic, harmonious sounds as their alarm clock say they feel less sleep inertia. a smart alarm clock is another option. these smartphone apps monitor your sleep and estimate which stage of sleep you are in. then, they wake you up during a lighter stage of sleep when you are less likely to feel the effects of sleep inertia. research suggests they do not always accurately identify your sleep stage, however.	these smartphone apps monitor your sleep and estimate which stage of sleep you are in
what is the optimal duration of sleep?	some older children may still be inclined to nap and can benefit from doing so. in a study in china, where it is often more culturally appropriate to nap, children in grades 4-6 who took frequent naps after lunch showed signs of better behavior, academic achievement, and overall happiness. the existing research about napping and optimal timing of sleep episodes is inconclusive and acknowledges that what's best for one child can change over time and may not be what's best for another child of the same age. for this reason, parents, teachers, and child care workers may be able to best encourage optimal sleep for kids by being flexible and understanding about naps.	inconclusive
is caffeine good for lost sleep?	although good sleep hygiene varies based on a person's age, gender, and health status, most people can benefit by avoiding the following sleep disruptors. to practice good sleep hygiene, avoid consuming stimulants such as coffee, tea, energy or soft drinks, and chocolate before bedtime. research has shown that even moderate amounts of caffeine can disrupt sleep. to ensure that caffeine doesn't interfere with your sleep, have your last caffeinated beverage or snack at least six hours before bedtime. if you are very sensitive to caffeine, it's recommended that you have your last caffeinated drink 12 hours before bedtime.	caffeine doesn't interfere with your sleep
is sleeping too much a bad thing?	what is a bad sleeper? and how much of that is something that's artificially constructed in our mind versus somebody who truly has a sleep problem? so yeah, i think that parents play a big role in these types of things. left to their own devices and with a little bit of help, parents can learn to really guide their kids into better sleep patterns and recognize problems when they exist. on what he tells new parents. number one, your child sleeps, it's impossible not to. now, what might be happening is that your child is not sleeping in a way that's predictable and efficient.	your child is not sleeping in a way that's predictable and efficient.
how does sleep-walking work?	we miss the camaraderie, mallette says. we may actually miss walking around. remote work, for many, means desks that are just a few steps from the bed - 16, to be exact, according to research from wellness company upright pose. milanak, the physical activity baked into an office lifestyle plays a role in how tired we feel at the end of the day. without walking to and from meetings and lunches, or spending energy commuting, remote workers may have lost many of the days' natural opportunities for movement and exercise. when we're sitting all day, we'll end the day feeling fatigued.	fatigued
does drinking alcohol affect my sleep	heavy drinking means more than 15 drinks per week for men and more than eight drinks per week for women. will a small amount of alcohol affect my sleep? drinking to excess will probably have a more negative impact on sleep than light or moderate alcohol consumption. however, since the effects of alcohol are different from person to person, even small amounts of alcohol can reduce sleep quality for some people. one 2018 study compared sleep quality among subjects who consumed different amounts of alcohol. when should i stop drinking prior to bed to minimize sleep disruption? to reduce the risk of sleep disruptions, you should stop drinking alcohol at least four hours before bedtime.	drinking to excess will probably have a more negative impact on sleep
which is more important - sleep duration or sleep quality?	in taking care to get outside, especially in the morning, students can help keep their bodies and minds on track. this can lead to more productive days and more consistent, quality sleep at night. the study also stresses the importance of tending to our circadian clock. social distancing measures to combat covid-19 led to a decreased exposure to natural light. so while students had more time to sleep, the reduced sunlight exposure actually led to poorer quality sleep. the study concludes by highlighting our current built environment promotes a delayed circadian rhythm, and this often conflicts with the alignment of our social clock. by prioritizing their exposure to daylight and minimizing their time with artificial light, the authors suggest students can improve the quality and duration of their sleep, which leads to overall student success.	quality sleep at night
how do the characteristics of my mattress, such as its size and softness, affect my sleep?	while our family chose the amazon halo for our experiment, there are numerous sleep trackers available that are appropriate for kids, such as the garmin vivofit jr. 2 and fitbit ace 2 and 3. the data these trackers provide can offer a new perspective on your child's daily and nightly routines and sleep quality. do i vote for every child being constantly analyzed for data? certainly not. you have to do what makes you and your family comfortable. wearables can be a gentle, fun, non-invasive way of gaining insight into your child's inner workings. and, hey, now my daughter wakes up every morning and asks, can i check my sleep score?. how much sleep do babies and kids need? do your children get enough sleep? is your child getting enough sleep? here's how to tell.	wearables can be a gentle, fun, non-invasive
how does the hardness of the mattress affect sleep?	firmness and support are two of the most noteworthy factors of a new mattress. while often thought of interchangeably, these are two distinct factors that are important to consider separately. firmness is a measure of how the bed's surface feels when the sleeper lays down. does it feel soft, hard, or somewhere in between? does the body sink into the surface, or sit on top of it? support is a measure of how well a mattress supports the body to help maintain proper spinal alignment. does the bed sag or sink? does it provide adequate support to reduce discomfort in common pressure point areas?	does the body sink into the surface, or sit on top of it
is there such thing as sleeping too much?	a wealth of research shows that left side sleeping is the best sleeping position for you and the fetus in later pregnancy. as the baby grows, this improves circulation by preventing the pressure of the uterus from resting on the veins, back, and internal organs. switching to this position early on may make the transition easier for those who tend to favor stomach or back sleeping. on the other hand, sleep is a good thing to aim for in and of itself in the first trimester. don't worry too much if you can't drift off on your side.	don't worry too much
is it okay if i sleep at 3am but still clock 8 hours of sleep?	so even if you think, my child has narcolepsy. i read this book that chris wrote, and by god, i need help. even if you're wrong, at least you're arming yourself with the understanding that the behavior that you witnessed when you were spending the night in a hotel room with your kid at the soccer tournament, and he kicked violently all through the night, is not normal. so it's okay for you to seek more information and understanding about sleepwalking, the crazy teeth grinding, the unusual vocalizations and screaming that happen at night. the same mentor who told me 99% of sleep problems are parent sleep problems, would always tell parents to never watch their kids sleep.	it's okay
if i do take caffeinated products, when should i stop taking them if i want a good night's sleep?	even now there's a piece of research done recently that indicated it's regarded as masculine to be underslept. this is despite all the scientific evidence proving that a good night's sleep is vital to our short- and long-term health. people who sleep too much are looked down on. people who get the right amount of sleep, well why do you need that much? when i left university, i went into advertising, and i was highly stressed. i used alcohol to get to sleep, and then once i decided i didn't want to drink anymore, i couldn't get to sleep.	i couldn't get to sleep
when is the best time to take a nap during daytime?	sound-insulating curtains can minimize outside noise and are especially helpful for city dwellers. dark curtains also block out light and help trick your body into thinking it's nighttime. in addition to light and sound, the room temperature can also make or break a nap. a person's core temperature tends to drop during sleep, so keeping your nap space slightly cooler can signal sleep to your body. as is the case with nocturnal sleep, having comfortable bedding and breathable clothing may positively influence daytime napping. it can be difficult to keep up in a fast-paced world, but napping can effectively restore energy levels when used wisely. there isn't a single nap length and time of day that is optimal for everyone. sleep need, schedule, and personal preferences will all factor in. it might take some experimenting to figure out what works best for you, but sleeping during the day can be a part of a healthy sleep regimen.	there isn't a single nap length and time of day
i share a room with my siblings who are scared of the dark and insist on having a nightlight on throughout the whole night. to stop this, i've been covering my face with my blanket, but i read that this is actually bad for me as it makes it hard to breathe, but so far i have not felt any of such effects. should i change my behaviour, or can i keep doing this?	the conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and concision. sleep foundation (sf): thanks for your time today! i'd like to begin by discussing your background. how did you initially become interested in this field of sleep? dave gibson (dg): i had a childhood where sleep wasn't really mentioned. i had two parents - one who didn't sleep, my mother, and one who slept every time he could, which was my dad. i have my mom's sleep genes, so i have to work hard at getting to sleep. so when i look back to my history, i had poor sleep.	i had poor sleep
why do people talk in their sleep?	by adulthood, sleep talking is less common, affecting only 6% of adults on a weekly basis. researchers still do not know with certainty what causes sleep talking. in most cases, sleep talking is harmless and does not require treatment. sleep talking can occur with other parasomnias, or abnormal behaviors that occur during sleep, such as sleepwalking, nightmares, and teeth grinding. researchers have found that these parasomnias share some genetic associations, which may explain why sleep talking can run in families. sleep talking is twice as common among people with psychiatric disorders, especially post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd).	sleep talking is harmless and does not require treatment
what are some warning signs of sleep deprivation?	the sleep hygiene principles for school-age kids listed above also apply to teenagers. sleep recommendations for teens change once they reach the age of 18. according to current guidelines, young adults between the ages of 18 and 25 should get 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night. as many as 50% of children experience some sort of sleep problem before reaching adulthood. some childhood sleep problems also affect adults while others are much more common for kids and teenagers. sleep-deprived teenagers are also at higher risk of being involved in car accidents. identifying the warning signs of childhood sleep problems is important for parents.	car accidents
do dreams have meaning?	children are less likely to have positive recurring dreams, though they have significantly more recurring dreams that inspire a neutral emotional response. the idea that dreams have hidden meanings in their content was a popular component of freudian dream theory. but, there is little evidence to support the idea that dreams with the same content or themes have the same meaning for everyone. however, examining what your dreams mean to you personally can still be meaningful, particularly in a therapeutic context. experiencing recurring dreams may point at underlying issues regardless of the dream's content. adults who experience frequent recurring dreams tend to have worse psychological health than those who do not, and many experts theorize that these dreams may be a way to work through unmet needs or process trauma.	dreams with the same content or themes have the same meaning for everyone
what type of exercise should i do to sleep better?	i can't imagine why that's not common practice in all universities. it should be absolutely spoon fed to children and university graduates, because it's a no-brainer. it's now proven that children who get better sleep get better results in exams. i approach health from all different angles, so i get people coming to me either for a specific health need or a global intervention. and it's interesting when you look at the things that are components of health. you can't get away from exercise, sleep, and food. and they all crossover and interconnect. when you look at the rise in obesity and the decrease in sleep, they're pretty much interlinked, too.	food
is it alright to split 8h of sleep between sleeping at night and napping, for example 4h at night and 4h nap time?	this can be particularly tricky for night shift workers because they will potentially miss out on social activities and time to run errands. if you normally work a night shift, schedule your sleep time in order to wake up close to the beginning of your next shift, rather than going to sleep immediately upon returning home. studies have shown the split nap schedule is also effective. this involves sleeping for a few hours when you get home from work, then staying awake and taking a long nap that ends close to the start of your next shift.	studies have shown the split nap schedule is also effective
will meditation before bed help me sleep better?	sleeping well can further relieve pain, which could then lead to even better sleep over time. meditation might also improve sleep directly, even in people not experiencing heightened stress or pain. whether you are facing worries or not, meditation can induce a relaxation response that might help prepare for sleep. people who meditate also experience changes in brain activity, which carry over into sleep. there are multiple ways to meditate. some types of meditation are more appropriate to do in the hours before bed, while others could work better while lying in bed. sitting and moving meditations are best to do during the day or before bed.	some types of meditation are more appropriate to do in the hours before bed
is sleeping less more beneficial?	certain exercises may be more beneficial for sleep than others. these include yoga, light stretching, and breathing exercises. the role sleep plays in our physical activity levels has not been studied as thoroughly, and much of the research has focused on differences in physical activity between people with sleep disorders and healthy individuals. however, most of these studies have concluded that those who experience poor sleep are less active than those with healthy sleep cycles. in particular, people with certain sleep disorders are not as likely to exercise during the day. adults with insomnia tend to be less active than those without insomnia.	certain exercises may be more beneficial for sleep than others
do you think healthy device like fitbit useful to detect sleep hygiene and improve sleeping habits?	several steps can help avoid the dangers of drowsy driving. some tips are beneficial right before or during a trip, and others work to build lifestyle habits for healthy sleep. over the long-term, good sleep is the best protection against drowsy driving. focusing on sleep hygiene, which includes your habits and sleep setting, can enable better sleep every night. examples of sleep hygiene include maintaining a stable sleep schedule, limiting the use of electronic devices before bed, and making sure that your bedroom is quiet, dark, and conducive to uninterrupted rest. in addition to sleep hygiene improvements, you should talk with a doctor if you have persistent or severe problems with falling or staying asleep or if you regularly have daytime sleepiness. working with your doctor can identify the optimal approach to enhancing your sleep, which may involve testing to determine if you are affected by an underlying sleep disorder.	limiting the use of electronic devices before bed
what should i do if i always play my phone before sleeping?	i was never told that sleep was important, was never encouraged to do it, and i was never educated on it. in fact, if i had behaved properly and if i'd have done well at school, i could stay up late at night to watch the midweek sport, so i was getting rewarded for losing sleep. and by the time i got to my teenage years, i was allowed to play in a band midweek until midnight. my dad was a former semi-pro musician, so i was encouraged to follow that, and i'd be the kid at the back of the class falling asleep.	play in a band midweek until midnight
what is the optimal amount of sleep for an adult?	the american academy of sleep medicine notes that while sleeping for seven to nine hours should be sufficient for most healthy adults, sleeping for more than nine hours may be necessary for younger adults or when recovering from sleep deprivation or illness. different people require different amounts of sleep each night. sleeping an adequate amount is important to your health. since there is no universally recommended sleep time, identifying your personal optimal amount of sleep might require experimentation. you can estimate how much sleep you need by paying attention to how long you sleep and noting how well you feel.	seven to nine hours
will higher or lower pillows affect our sleep quality?	estrogen plays a role in the metabolism of serotonin and other neurotransmitters that affect our sleep-wake cycle. estrogen also helps keep our body temperature low at night, and therefore more conducive to restful sleep. estrogen also has an antidepressant effect. with less estrogen, women may experience higher body temperatures, lower quality sleep, and poorer mood. our sleep-wake cycle also changes as we age, and loses its consistency. we begin to feel tired earlier, and wake up earlier in the morning, leading to less sleep overall. this may also explain why older adults, including menopausal women, are at increased risk for insomnia.	lower
is it ok for me to consume coffee at night even if it does not affect me from falling asleep?	coffee and many types of tea contain caffeine. caffeine is generally safe in moderate quantities but can be harmful in excess or when consumed late in the day. drinking coffee in the afternoon or evening can also negatively impact sleep. caffeine sensitivity varies from person to person. in general, it's best to avoid caffeine for at least six hours before your planned bedtime to prevent sleep problems. earlier in the day, caffeine may provide a useful pick-me-up to counteract daytime sleepiness related to jet lag or travel fatigue; however, it's important not to rely on caffeine at the expense of sufficient nightly sleep.	can also negatively impact sleep
how much sleep do students need	studies have shown that 70% of college students and almost 73% of high school students do not receive the amount of sleep recommended by experts on an average night. while scientists continue to investigate how much sleep people need, they agree that sleep needs change throughout a person's lifetime. the national sleep foundation has issued recommendations for school-age children and young adults. experts agree that high schoolers need between 8 and 10 hours of quality sleep each night to function properly, which is about an hour more per day than adults require. this greater need may be due to several unique features of adolescent health and development.	sleep needs change throughout a person's lifetime
how many hours will it take for me to fall alseep after exercising usually?	for some people, exercising too late in the day can keep them up at night. in addition to elevating your mood, the endorphin release associated with exercise can energize your brain, leading some people to feel more alert. for this reason, experts recommend avoiding exercise at least 2 hours before bed so those effects can wear off. however, the drop in body temperature that occurs after exercising can begin 30 to 90 minutes later, which may help with falling asleep. to figure out the right time for you to exercise, consider keeping a sleep diary. record when you exercise, what type of exercise you did and for how long, when you went to bed, and how long it took you to fall asleep.	2 hours
what type of exercises are recommended for people who have insomnia?	this type of exercise can improve total sleep time, ability to sleep through the night, and overall sleep quality. it can also help people with insomnia fall asleep faster, leading some researchers to recommend aerobic exercise as a treatment for the disorder. moderate- to high-intensity exercise has been shown to reduce anxiety for several hours. in one study, a single session of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise significantly reduced the anxiety of people with insomnia. this type of exercise also cut the time it took them to fall asleep in half while increasing the amount of time they spent asleep overall.	aerobic exercise
what should i do if it is very noisy outside while i am sleeping?	she agreed and even seemed excited. i hoped this at-home experiment would provide insight into what her day was going to look like. could we predict her next day according to her daily sleep scores, sleep graphs, and daily energy output? in our home, we have strict nighttime routines, complete with timepoints for activities like brushing teeth, ensuring we abide by bedtime. because i am hyper-aware of sleep routines, proper sleep hygiene, and what stages of my sleep cycle i should be in throughout the night and when, i wondered if i could apply the data gathered by a wearable to my daughter.	apply the data gathered by a wearable to my daughter

i have extremely vivid dreams. is this a sign of bad sleep or good sleep?	dreams appear to be an important part of normal, healthy sleep. at the same time, though, nightmares can disrupt sleep and even affect a person during their waking hours. given that virtually everyone has dreams, both good and bad, it's natural to wonder how dreaming affects sleep quality, whether nightmares are bad for sleep, and how to avoid bad dreams. dreaming is a normal part of healthy sleep. good sleep has been connected to better cognitive function and emotional health, and studies have also linked dreams to effective thinking, memory, and emotional processing. in this way, many experts believe dreaming is either a reflection of or a contributor to quality sleep.	good sleep
i keep waking up in the middle of the night to eat. is that good?	if your allergies keep you up at night, you may be missing out on sleep. without a good night's sleep, you end up feeling tired and grumpy the next day. being tired can impair your performance at school and work, negatively affecting your health and wellbeing. poor sleep also heightens anxiety and stress response, which in turn, makes it harder to fall asleep. allergies don't just impact your ability to fall asleep; they also interfere with your ability to stay asleep. people with allergies may wake up due to a congested nose, sneezing or coughing fit in the middle of the night.	people with allergies may wake up
should i exercise before going to sleep?	such exercise, when done at least several hours before bedtime, can help you sleep better at night. since high-activity yoga forms elevate the heart rate, it's best to avoid these practices right before bedtime. poses done before bedtime should encourage the body to relax and sleep. keep in mind that the sleep environment should primarily be used for sleeping; find another quiet location to do your yoga poses before you go to sleep. be sure you are in a safe space free of any potential hazards. if you have any concerns about your yoga practice, consult a yoga instructor and/or a physician. remember that yoga is not a substitute for medical treatment. in the event of persistent sleep disturbances or other concerns, consult your physician to develop a treatment plan.	find another quiet location to do your yoga poses
does sleep makes you grow taller	numerous studies have shown that, generally, exercise improves sleep. but, exercise may impact the body differently depending on the time of day a person exercises. we look at the benefits and drawbacks of working out before bed and discuss the best time to exercise for a good night's sleep. when giving sleep hygiene advice, experts often warn that late afternoon and evening exercise can disrupt sleep. some sleep researchers speculate that, as a result, many individuals who are unable to exercise earlier in the day may skip workouts altogether. however, a growing body of evidence suggests that working out before bed does not make it harder for most adults to fall asleep and may even help some get better rest.	working out before bed does not make it harder for most adults to fall asleep
what are the activities i should limit before bedtime to ensure that i do not face difficulty in sleeping?	she agreed and even seemed excited. i hoped this at-home experiment would provide insight into what her day was going to look like. could we predict her next day according to her daily sleep scores, sleep graphs, and daily energy output? in our home, we have strict nighttime routines, complete with timepoints for activities like brushing teeth, ensuring we abide by bedtime. because i am hyper-aware of sleep routines, proper sleep hygiene, and what stages of my sleep cycle i should be in throughout the night and when, i wondered if i could apply the data gathered by a wearable to my daughter.	brushing teeth
how can i encourage myself to sleep earlier?	this wearables experience changed me, maybe more than it changed my daughter. i found myself altering how i approached her right from the beginning of the day depending on how well she slept. if she didn't sleep well or i noticed a lot of nighttime disturbances in her graph, i would allow her more leeway. giving her the benefit of doubt seemed to ease the bumps we'd hit throughout our daytime hours together, and even allow us to have a quiet and calm drift into the evening. this insight into my daughter's nine-year-old brain made me realize something so simple: we're not that much different.	giving her the benefit of doubt
how can i improve sleep hygiene?	different types of cbt have been developed for specific problems such as depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. in addition, cbt for insomnia (cbt-i) has a proven track record in reducing sleeping problems. a large clinical trial also showed that cbt-i could reduce symptoms of many mental health conditions, improving emotional well-being and decreasing psychotic episodes. whether and how types of cbt can be combined or sequenced to address both sleep and mental health problems is subject to ongoing research, but for many patients, help from a trained counselor to reframe their thinking can meaningfully improve both their sleep and mental state. a common cause of sleeping problems is poor sleep hygiene. stepping up sleep hygiene by cultivating habits and a bedroom setting that are conducive to sleep can go a long way in reducing sleep disruptions. finding the best routines and bedroom arrangement may take some trial and error to determine what's best for you, but that process can pay dividends in helping you fall asleep quickly and stay asleep through the night.	cultivating habits and a bedroom setting that are conducive to sleep
is alcohol limiting my sleep quality?	heavy drinking means more than 15 drinks per week for men and more than eight drinks per week for women. will a small amount of alcohol affect my sleep? drinking to excess will probably have a more negative impact on sleep than light or moderate alcohol consumption. however, since the effects of alcohol are different from person to person, even small amounts of alcohol can reduce sleep quality for some people. one 2018 study compared sleep quality among subjects who consumed different amounts of alcohol. when should i stop drinking prior to bed to minimize sleep disruption? to reduce the risk of sleep disruptions, you should stop drinking alcohol at least four hours before bedtime.	even small amounts of alcohol can reduce sleep quality
how do i fall asleep when i have difficulty doing so?	i definitely do not advise parents letting them cry themselves to sleep. i encourage babies to be comforted and soothed. i would start by having parents teach a baby how to self-soothe. so for example, never put a baby down asleep. the aim here is to put your baby down to sleep, aware of their surroundings and drowsy. the goal is to put babies down almost asleep, so that they learn the ability to fall asleep on their own. babies get mini sleeps - when they wake up, they need to have the opportunity to get back to sleep on their own.	on their own
will taking sleep supplements, e.g. melatonin pills be detrimental for my health in the long run?	aasm recommends against the use of over-the-counter sleeping pills and dietary supplements like melatonin and valerian. potential side effects can vary based on the specific sleep aid and whether the person taking it has any other health problems or medications that they take. in general, there are potential negative effects that can occur with almost all sleep medications, although the likelihood of these effects may be higher with some sleep aids. in addition to this general list of potential side effects, there are risks that exist only with some sleep aids. for example, some sleeping pills may have detrimental effects on other health conditions.	some sleeping pills may have detrimental effects on other health conditions.
what is the best position to fall asleep?	positive parenting involves being responsive and warm toward your child. preliminary research shows that caregivers who sleep less experience higher levels of stress. higher levels of stress are associated with difficulty regulating emotions. this difficulty may help explain why caregivers who have less or fragmented sleep, or who take longer to fall asleep, show less positive parenting in the hour before their child's bedtime than caregivers who get more sleep. prioritizing your own sleep helps you have the energy to care for your new child, so learning what works best for you and your child is key.	caregivers who get more sleep

why does sleeping with your partner helps you sleep better	if your sleep partner or child seems to mumble or carry on conversations while they sleep, they are likely sleep talking. sleep talkers can be loud or quiet. they may form coherent sentences, appear to answer questions, or speak gibberish. whatever their talking sounds like, sleep talkers tend to have one thing in common: they rarely remember what they say while they are asleep. we explain why people talk in their sleep, what it means, and how to get better sleep if you share your bed with a sleep talker. sleep talking describes any kind of talking during sleep, from clear, understandable statements to seemingly random words and word-like sounds.	why people talk in their sleep
how does smoking affect my sleeping behaviour?	it's out in the open your hamstring hurts, let's talk about it so we can figure out we need to do something. but we don't sometimes talk about sleep in meaningful ways. so my hope is this book creates a conversation about it, because i don't think we can talk about it too much. and so when you're out with your friends, and you're talking about, my kid does this in his sleep and i read something about that one time, my hope is that this gets people talking, and moving in directions of finding that solution.	my kid does this in his sleep
how many hours do a adult need to sleep for a good grade?	using tv as a sleep aid is a fairly common practice, with about 60% of adults watching television in the hour before they sleep. watching tv before bed can be a relaxing way to unwind after a stressful day. that said, this nightly tv habit may be doing you more harm than good. we'll discuss the benefits and drawbacks of watching tv before bed and how you can modify your bedtime routine to help improve your sleep quality. for many, watching tv before bed offers a much needed chance to relax. this familiar bedtime ritual adds background noise.	60%
i don't like the taste of horlicks and i'm lactose intolerant, is there anything else i can drink to help me fall asleep?	when i'm not rested, i'm grumpy, crabby, and generally unpleasant. and, like her mom, my little girl is, too - but i had lost sight of that before a wearable helped me remember. although we received a lot of new information from the wearable, we did not change much in my daughter's schedule - no cancelled weekend movie nights in favor of sleep on the weekends, for sure. she needs to be a kid and have those cheating-the-system moments! what this experiment really helped me understand, however, is how significantly sleep impacts her every day. it also taught me how to approach her during an off-day.	when i'm not rested
will turning on the air conditioner have different effects on sleep compared to turning on fan?	also, some people find that background noise helps to distract them from anxious or intrusive thoughts and prepares the mind for sleep. research studies have produced conflicting data about whether adding a stream of background noise improves sleep quality. one study of the effects of adding sound from an air conditioner in the home found no positive impact on sleep. in another experiment, researchers investigated the effect of broadcasting white noise into the rooms of hospitalized patients and found that white noise improved sleep quality over the course of three nights compared to a control group. a third study of patients who were having trouble sleeping showed that white noise helped them fall asleep 38% more quickly.	no positive impact on sleep
i feel good even with only just 6 hours of sleep. maybe my body is built differently and i do not need 8 hours of sleep like others?	this wearables experience changed me, maybe more than it changed my daughter. i found myself altering how i approached her right from the beginning of the day depending on how well she slept. if she didn't sleep well or i noticed a lot of nighttime disturbances in her graph, i would allow her more leeway. giving her the benefit of doubt seemed to ease the bumps we'd hit throughout our daytime hours together, and even allow us to have a quiet and calm drift into the evening. this insight into my daughter's nine-year-old brain made me realize something so simple: we're not that much different.	we're not that much different
why do i sleepwalk?	even now there's a piece of research done recently that indicated it's regarded as masculine to be underslept. this is despite all the scientific evidence proving that a good night's sleep is vital to our short- and long-term health. people who sleep too much are looked down on. people who get the right amount of sleep, well why do you need that much? when i left university, i went into advertising, and i was highly stressed. i used alcohol to get to sleep, and then once i decided i didn't want to drink anymore, i couldn't get to sleep.	i used alcohol
how is sleep beneficial?	ptsd generally makes it difficult for people to relax. this may lead to lighter, fragmented sleep in which the sleeper is more sensitive to physical changes in the airway. similarly, people with ptsd often experience nightmares, which may be exacerbated due to sleep apnea's effect on sleep quality. researchers have found that treating sleep apnea can help ease ptsd symptoms. stress reduction may have a beneficial effect on sleep quality and vice-versa. we address how to sleep better when stressed, and how to manage stress to enhance sleep. as there is no one-size-fits-all solution to managing stress and improving sleep, individuals may need to experiment with different approaches and work with a medical professional to find the best solution for their needs.	stress reduction
there are loads of energy drinks in the market now with those that promise an immediate 5 hours energy burst. should i be consuming those?	energy drinks are sold in a large format (12-16 ounces) or as energy shots (1-3 ounces) and usually include caffeine and other compounds intended to have a stimulant effect. many energy drinks have high levels of sugar as well. the quantity of caffeine in energy drinks is often considerably higher than that in coffee or tea. rapid consumption of caffeine, such as through energy shots, can cause bodily stress from overstimulation. since energy drinks have a powerful stimulant effect, limit your consumption of them while traveling. stay away from energy drinks for a minimum of six hours before you plan to go to bed, don't drink them with alcohol, and avoid rapidly consuming them.	avoid rapidly consuming them.
what are suggested routines i may adopt for better sleep hygiene?	she agreed and even seemed excited. i hoped this at-home experiment would provide insight into what her day was going to look like. could we predict her next day according to her daily sleep scores, sleep graphs, and daily energy output? in our home, we have strict nighttime routines, complete with timepoints for activities like brushing teeth, ensuring we abide by bedtime. because i am hyper-aware of sleep routines, proper sleep hygiene, and what stages of my sleep cycle i should be in throughout the night and when, i wondered if i could apply the data gathered by a wearable to my daughter.	timepoints for activities like brushing teeth
can i eat a snack before sleeping?	choosing a nighttime snack can be complicated. not only is research inconclusive about which are the best foods for sleep, but there is also discussion about whether or not it is healthy to eat too close to bedtime. it is traditionally recommended to avoid eating too late at night. some studies show that eating before bed can contribute to obesity, and a few studies also suggest that eating high-fat or high-carbohydrate meals close to bedtime might make it harder to fall asleep. however, emerging research suggests that eating certain foods before bed may have some benefits.	eating certain foods before bed may have some benefits.
what exercises should i do to sleep better?	i can't imagine why that's not common practice in all universities. it should be absolutely spoon fed to children and university graduates, because it's a no-brainer. it's now proven that children who get better sleep get better results in exams. i approach health from all different angles, so i get people coming to me either for a specific health need or a global intervention. and it's interesting when you look at the things that are components of health. you can't get away from exercise, sleep, and food. and they all crossover and interconnect. when you look at the rise in obesity and the decrease in sleep, they're pretty much interlinked, too.	food
do waterbeds provide a more conducive sleeping environment as compared to traditional beds?	although not as common as foam-, latex-, and coil-based beds, these types of mattresses are worth considering for their unique attributes. airbeds, not to be confused with temporary inflatable mattresses, have air chamber support cores that offer the ability to fine-tune the firmness of the mattress. waterbeds feature a support core made from water-filled tubes, but they aren't very supportive and can be incredibly messy if ruptured. while the western concept of a futon includes a frame, traditional japanese futons are placed on the floor. they may appeal to anyone looking to live more minimally. traditional futons offer firm support, and they can be stowed away to free up space during the day.	they aren't very supportive
how do i know that i have a sleeping disorder?	so i do think that between technology and children, kids' weight, other medications that they're on for other disorders - and that may be fantastically appropriate for those conditions, but do carry with them some sort of sleep side effects - i think there's probably more sleep problems now than there have been in the past. and the problem is, as a medical doctor, i received a one hour lecture on sleep during the four years i was in medical school. and when you start looking at the most common complaints that people have when they go to see a doctor, one of them is fatigue and sleepiness, that's in the top seven.	between technology and children
what is the fastest or most efficient method to fall asleep?	using music can also decrease the time it takes to fall asleep. in a study of women with symptoms of insomnia, participants played a self-selected album when getting into bed for 10 consecutive nights. before adding music to their evening routine it took participants from 27 to 69 minutes to fall asleep, after adding music it only took 6 to 13 minutes. in addition to facilitating quickly falling asleep and improving sleep quality, playing music before bed can improve sleep efficiency, which means more time that you are in bed is actually spent sleeping. improved sleep efficiency equals more consistent rest and less waking up during the night.	playing music before bed
what is sol	but what exactly is memory foam? what is it made of, how does it work, and how do you know if it's the right choice for you? in this guide to all things memory foam, we'll break down the ins and outs of the material, how it's used in mattresses, and what to look for as a smart mattress shopper. check out our full guide with research if you're looking to find the top-rated memory foam mattresses? first thing's first: what is memory foam, physically? the main component of memory foam is a polymer (a substance with large molecules, consisting of many small, similar subunits bonded together) called polyurethane.	polyurethane
i often get sleep paralysis. is there a reason why?	because of the connection between sleep paralysis and general sleeping problems, improving sleep hygiene is a common focus in preventing sleep paralysis. sleep hygiene refers to a person's bedroom setting and daily habits that influence sleep quality. improving sleep hygiene is frequently incorporated into cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (cbt-i), a type of talk therapy that works to reframe negative thoughts and emotions that detract from sleep. a specific form of cbt has been developed for sleep paralysis, but more research is needed to validate its effectiveness. cbt has an established track record in addressing mental health conditions like anxiety and ptsd that may be factors influencing the risk of sleep paralysis. some medications are known to suppress rem sleep, and these may help to stop sleep paralysis. these medications can have side effects, though, and may cause a rebound in rem sleep when someone stops taking them. for these reasons, it's important to talk with a doctor before taking any medication in order to discuss its potential benefits and downsides.	the connection between sleep paralysis and general sleeping problems
how long will it take for me to change my sleep habits?	when i'm not rested, i'm grumpy, crabby, and generally unpleasant. and, like her mom, my little girl is, too - but i had lost sight of that before a wearable helped me remember. although we received a lot of new information from the wearable, we did not change much in my daughter's schedule - no cancelled weekend movie nights in favor of sleep on the weekends, for sure. she needs to be a kid and have those cheating-the-system moments! what this experiment really helped me understand, however, is how significantly sleep impacts her every day. it also taught me how to approach her during an off-day.	weekends
how does sleep affect my mood for the day?	together, we decided on the amazon halo. the halo is a relatively inexpensive fitness wearable that does not have a screen (score!) but tracks sleep. the halo comes in three default band colors: black, silver, and light pink. there are also a variety of both fabric and silicone replacement bands available in many different colors. we settled on the color unicorn, a soft fabric band with light aqua and pink. next, we downloaded the amazon halo app to my phone, and we were off! my expectation was that if my daughter's sleep scores were in the 90s - demonstrating that she cycled through four stages of sleep with optimal time spent in each - her mood, energy, and outlook for the day would be positive.	positive
what is the optimum nap duration?	it is recommended that those who are pregnant or breastfeeding should avoid coffee, or limit intake to 16 ounces or less per day (about two cups of coffee). during pregnancy, caffeine can be passed to the baby through the placenta. a trace amount of caffeine can also be found in breast milk. if you are pregnant or breastfeeding and concerned about your caffeine intake, talk to your health care provider about what steps you should take to ensure optimum health for you and your baby. caffeine can impact the onset of sleep and reduce sleep time, efficiency, and satisfaction levels.	16 ounces or less per day
i have an irregular sleep and wake cycle but i am able to get 7 hours (accumulative) sleeping time per day including napping time.  do i have to adjust my sleep and wake cycle?	she agreed and even seemed excited. i hoped this at-home experiment would provide insight into what her day was going to look like. could we predict her next day according to her daily sleep scores, sleep graphs, and daily energy output? in our home, we have strict nighttime routines, complete with timepoints for activities like brushing teeth, ensuring we abide by bedtime. because i am hyper-aware of sleep routines, proper sleep hygiene, and what stages of my sleep cycle i should be in throughout the night and when, i wondered if i could apply the data gathered by a wearable to my daughter.	throughout the night and when
what is the minimum amount of sleep i need?	several components are involved in the construction of a platform bed. some of those components are required while others are optional. there are two necessary components of a platform bed: the platform and the legs. the platform is the part of the frame upon which the mattress goes. a reliable platform holds up the mattress and is what allows you to use a platform bed without a box spring. in the design of these beds, the platform cannot sit flush against the ground, which means that it needs supports underneath it. the minimum amount of support is four legs with one at each corner of the frame.	four legs
does tracking my sleep cycle lead me to be more self-aware of myself?	this wearables experience changed me, maybe more than it changed my daughter. i found myself altering how i approached her right from the beginning of the day depending on how well she slept. if she didn't sleep well or i noticed a lot of nighttime disturbances in her graph, i would allow her more leeway. giving her the benefit of doubt seemed to ease the bumps we'd hit throughout our daytime hours together, and even allow us to have a quiet and calm drift into the evening. this insight into my daughter's nine-year-old brain made me realize something so simple: we're not that much different.	i found myself altering how i approached her
how long should i sleep so that i can be prepared for a competition the following day?	i was never told that sleep was important, was never encouraged to do it, and i was never educated on it. in fact, if i had behaved properly and if i'd have done well at school, i could stay up late at night to watch the midweek sport, so i was getting rewarded for losing sleep. and by the time i got to my teenage years, i was allowed to play in a band midweek until midnight. my dad was a former semi-pro musician, so i was encouraged to follow that, and i'd be the kid at the back of the class falling asleep.	until midnight
if alcohol makes me sleepy, why is it bad for sleep?	even with increased caffeine consumption, sleep deprivation catches up. people may be especially aware of their long-term sleep loss after they consume caffeine because they do not experience the pick-me-up they expected, and instead feel sleepy. sleepiness can also be a symptom of abstinence from caffeine, which is why regular caffeine users may feel overly sleepy in the morning when they have gone all night without caffeine. since caffeine can be both beneficial and harmful depending on the dose, it is important to find a level of consumption that is healthy for you. the food and drug administration (fda) recommendation for safe daily caffeine consumption sits around 400mg, or 4-5 cups of coffee per day.	abstinence from caffeine
is using my phone before sleeping bad?	together, we decided on the amazon halo. the halo is a relatively inexpensive fitness wearable that does not have a screen (score!) but tracks sleep. the halo comes in three default band colors: black, silver, and light pink. there are also a variety of both fabric and silicone replacement bands available in many different colors. we settled on the color unicorn, a soft fabric band with light aqua and pink. next, we downloaded the amazon halo app to my phone, and we were off! my expectation was that if my daughter's sleep scores were in the 90s - demonstrating that she cycled through four stages of sleep with optimal time spent in each - her mood, energy, and outlook for the day would be positive.	we were off
if blue light from screens is the reason for disturbing the sleep cycle, will wearing blue light glasses combat the negative effects on sleep?	avoiding technology which emits blue light is key, particularly for teenagers. blue light stops the production of melatonin, which is the hormone that produces our desire to sleep. teenagers are more sensitive to the blue light that technology screens emit. so always look at putting dimmers on the blue light technology and wearing glasses that filter out blue light to get that blue light out of your system, ideally an hour before bedtime. look at some form of mindfulness or meditation to help children to relax and switch off. there's lots of research now showing that mindfulness, meditation, or yoga nidra all create a brainwave that's very similar to the deep sleep brainwave, so they get you into that stage quicker.	ideally an hour before bedtime
how can i improve my sleep	using a wearable can help us pay attention and make small adjustments to daily practices, like sticking to a bedtime routine. these adjustments can enormously impact our moods, attitudes, and cognitive function. using a wearable has helped me gain insight into and improve my sleep routines. my experience prompted me to wonder, if sleep-tracking wearables help adults make positive lifestyle adjustments, would sleep tracking be beneficial for children, too? as the editor-in-chief of sleep foundation, i eat, breathe, and sleep sleep! for this reason, i felt excited to see how a sleep-tracking wearable might impact my nine-year-old daughter.	using a wearable has helped me gain insight into and improve my sleep routines
does one's water intake affect sleep quality?	this decrease in body temperature does not appear to affect sleep quality, however. participants in the study also experienced an increased heart rate. a similar study of youth soccer players found that cold water immersion after an evening training session did not affect sleep. cold showers might not improve sleep because of cold water's stimulating properties. cold water immersion raises levels of cortisol and norepinephrine. cortisol is involved in boosting alertness levels, and consequently, cortisol levels in the body usually fall in preparation for sleep. in one study, participants compared the energy boost of a cold shower to the effects of drinking caffeine.	decrease in body temperature does not appear to affect sleep quality
how often should i exercise in a week to have a better sleep?	i can't imagine why that's not common practice in all universities. it should be absolutely spoon fed to children and university graduates, because it's a no-brainer. it's now proven that children who get better sleep get better results in exams. i approach health from all different angles, so i get people coming to me either for a specific health need or a global intervention. and it's interesting when you look at the things that are components of health. you can't get away from exercise, sleep, and food. and they all crossover and interconnect. when you look at the rise in obesity and the decrease in sleep, they're pretty much interlinked, too.	exams
if i sleep for five hours and have four 30 minute naps in the day, will it add up to the 7 hours of sleep i need?	much of their sleep takes place in short naps lasting 35 minutes or less. they can sleep lying down or standing up. horses spend the bulk of their day eating or resting. resting accounts for five to seven hours, with as few as four hours of that time fully asleep. like giraffes, horses can sleep standing up - but only as long as they're not in rem sleep. during rem sleep, the brain temporarily paralyzes muscles, preventing humans and animals alike from acting out dreams and injuring themselves. horses can spend 30 minutes each day in rem sleep, but they need a comfortable place to lie down to do so.	resting
is there any different need between gender on sleep?	in general, women and men have the same nightly sleep needs. the national sleep foundation recommends that healthy adults of any gender get between seven and nine hours of sleep per night. teens and younger children need more sleep. growing evidence indicates that, on average, women in the united states get more total sleep each day than men when counting nightly sleep and daytime naps. in one large study, the average time difference depended on age and ranged from five to 28 minutes. at the same time, women experience more sleep fragmentation and lower quality sleep.	healthy adults of any gender get between seven and nine hours of sleep per night
how can i improve my sleep quality	using a wearable can help us pay attention and make small adjustments to daily practices, like sticking to a bedtime routine. these adjustments can enormously impact our moods, attitudes, and cognitive function. using a wearable has helped me gain insight into and improve my sleep routines. my experience prompted me to wonder, if sleep-tracking wearables help adults make positive lifestyle adjustments, would sleep tracking be beneficial for children, too? as the editor-in-chief of sleep foundation, i eat, breathe, and sleep sleep! for this reason, i felt excited to see how a sleep-tracking wearable might impact my nine-year-old daughter.	using a wearable
is it good to do yoga before sleeping?	such exercise, when done at least several hours before bedtime, can help you sleep better at night. since high-activity yoga forms elevate the heart rate, it's best to avoid these practices right before bedtime. poses done before bedtime should encourage the body to relax and sleep. keep in mind that the sleep environment should primarily be used for sleeping; find another quiet location to do your yoga poses before you go to sleep. be sure you are in a safe space free of any potential hazards. if you have any concerns about your yoga practice, consult a yoga instructor and/or a physician. remember that yoga is not a substitute for medical treatment. in the event of persistent sleep disturbances or other concerns, consult your physician to develop a treatment plan.	it's best to avoid these practices right before bedtime
how does coffee affect sleep	coffee drinking is widespread, especially in the united states. an estimated 75% of american adults drink coffee, and nearly 50% do so on a daily basis. coffee contains caffeine and other compounds that, together, increase alertness and improve mood. as a result, many people use coffee as part of their morning routines to help them feel awake and ready for the day. even though coffee is a stimulant, some people find drinking it does not give them the outcome they desire. we discuss the potential reasons coffee might seem to make you feel sleepy rather than alert, as well as what you can do to counteract these effects.	coffee might seem to make you feel sleepy rather than alert
why do i still feel tired after sleeping?	when a person experiences fatigue, they often feel tired but do not usually fall asleep when they want to be awake. excessive sleepiness is often referred to as excessive daytime sleepiness, or eds, by physicians and sleep specialists. to eliminate or reduce your eds, you must first figure out why you are experiencing it. if you experience excessive sleepiness, you've probably asked yourself, why am i so sleepy during the day? there is no single, universal answer to that question because different people experience excessive daytime sleepiness (eds) for various reasons. if you don't have health or psychiatric problems that could be causing your eds, consider exploring the possibility of a sleep disorder.	different people experience excessive daytime sleepiness (eds) for various reasons
why are people not conscious of the awaking session during sleep?	people may fall asleep at any moment, with brief naps ranging from just a few seconds to several minutes. they often wake from these short naps feeling much more alert and awake. during lapses in attention or brief periods of sleep, people with narcolepsy may perform activities with no conscious awareness and little memory of them afterward. while performing habitual activities, like eating, talking or typing, they may fall asleep and automatically continue the activity. usually, their performance declines, with a common example being writing that becomes an illegible scribble during brief sleep attacks. sleep paralysis is a temporary loss of voluntary muscle control while waking up or falling asleep.	little memory of them afterward
what are the factors affecting sleep	if you often wake up at night, whether from the headlights of a passing car or the noise of a family member in the hallway, you might be a light sleeper. light sleepers might be frustrated by having sleep interrupted by factors outside of their control. plus, getting high-quality, uninterrupted sleep is important to overall well-being. sleep affects nearly all aspects of health, from your mood and metabolism to your brain and your bones. if you are a light sleeper, it is beneficial to understand what is waking you up and figure out what you can do to sleep more soundly through the night.	sleep affects nearly all aspects of health
effects of sleep deprivation	the effects of sleep deprivation and sleep deficiency can be serious and far-reaching. acute sleep deprivation raises the risk of unintentional errors and accidents. drowsy driving, which involves slowed reaction time and the risk of microsleeps, can be life-threatening. people who are sleep deprived are more likely to struggle in school and work settings or to experience mood changes that may affect personal relationships. chronic sleep deprivation can contribute to a wide range of health problems. given these diverse and important impacts of sleep deprivation, it comes as no surprise that studies have found insufficient sleep to be tied with a greater overall risk of death as well as a lower quality of life.	the effects of sleep deprivation and sleep deficiency can be serious and far-reaching
what is the last timing to drink coffee before coffee starts affecting my sleep quality?	although coffee increases alertness, it has limited effects for higher cognitive processes, and it cannot mask underlying sleepiness forever. if you are feeling tired despite drinking coffee, you might be sleep-deprived. consider sleeping for longer, or examining your sleep quality to see if you might be experiencing unrefreshing sleep despite spending a long time in bed. studies show that drinking coffee within the six hours before bed can disrupt sleep, so consider limiting coffee to the morning and favoring sleep-promoting foods at night. food & drug administration recommends consuming no more than 400 milligrams of caffeine per day - the amount found in about four cups of coffee.	six hours
as a light sleeper, how do i create the optimal environment for sleep?	a relaxing environment is essential for a good night's rest. studies have shown people simply sleep better when their bedroom is optimized for light and noise levels, temperature, and comfort. and since sleep quality and duration are directly tied to other aspects of human health, a bedroom environment that promotes sleep can also improve how you feel while you're awake. best of all, creating the ideal bedroom doesn't need to break the bank. there are several cost-effective ways to make your sleep space more soothing and suited for rest. some people run hot in bed while others sleep somewhat cool.	creating the ideal bedroom
can i communicate with someone as they sleep talk?	because of the connection between sleep paralysis and general sleeping problems, improving sleep hygiene is a common focus in preventing sleep paralysis. sleep hygiene refers to a person's bedroom setting and daily habits that influence sleep quality. improving sleep hygiene is frequently incorporated into cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (cbt-i), a type of talk therapy that works to reframe negative thoughts and emotions that detract from sleep. a specific form of cbt has been developed for sleep paralysis, but more research is needed to validate its effectiveness. cbt has an established track record in addressing mental health conditions like anxiety and ptsd that may be factors influencing the risk of sleep paralysis. some medications are known to suppress rem sleep, and these may help to stop sleep paralysis. these medications can have side effects, though, and may cause a rebound in rem sleep when someone stops taking them. for these reasons, it's important to talk with a doctor before taking any medication in order to discuss its potential benefits and downsides.	it's important to talk with a doctor
is sleeping important	online or in-person support groups can help people with narcolepsy connect with others with the disease. check-ins with a mental health counselor can prevent, identify, and treat mood and anxiety disorders. eating a healthy diet is important for everyone, but it takes on added importance for people with narcolepsy because they have an elevated risk of obesity. the timing of meals is important as well. eating too late at night may interfere with normal digestion and is associated with sleep disruptions. if late dinners or snacks are heavy or spicy, they may cause acid reflux or indigestion that can worsen sleep quality.	eating too late at night may interfere with normal digestion
should i drink milk before i sleep?	drinking milk before bed does not appear to have documented negative side effects in most people. some people, however, might want to avoid milk. for example, people who have a dairy allergy, are lactose intolerant, or have irritable bowel syndrome with symptoms that are worsened by dairy probably should not use milk to promote sleep. if you are avoiding milk, you may want to opt for non-dairy sleep-inducing foods instead. some may worry that drinking milk before bed could promote weight gain. however, research suggests a glass of milk at night could help promote fitness.	not use milk to promote sleep
what should be the optimal length of nap?	the ideal nap length for you depends on how much time you have to sleep, how soon you need to feel increased alertness after your nap, and how long you want that energy boost to last. a shorter nap is ideal when you need to immediately wake up and get back to work, while a longer nap might be a better idea if you are experiencing or about to experience sleep deprivation. a power nap is a brief nap intended to increase performance after waking. the optimal length of a power nap is still up for debate, though short naps are often defined as falling under 30 minutes.	how much time you have to sleep
why does scrolling through social media affects sleep quality	lukewarm temperature showers may be the better option for menopausal women, however, in order to avoid triggering a hot flash. if possible, avoid letting screens play a part in your bedtime routine. electronic devices, including televisions, computers, tablets, and smartphones, emit an energizing blue light that causes the brain to think it's still daytime. exposure to this light at night, even for a few hours, can delay melatonin production, the hormone that makes you sleepy. you may also want to limit how often you scroll through social media. there's a link between increased social media use and difficulty sleeping, with women being more likely to report disturbed sleep than men.	there's a link between increased social media use and difficulty sleeping
does exercise late at night affect my sleep?	numerous studies have shown that, generally, exercise improves sleep. but, exercise may impact the body differently depending on the time of day a person exercises. we look at the benefits and drawbacks of working out before bed and discuss the best time to exercise for a good night's sleep. when giving sleep hygiene advice, experts often warn that late afternoon and evening exercise can disrupt sleep. some sleep researchers speculate that, as a result, many individuals who are unable to exercise earlier in the day may skip workouts altogether. however, a growing body of evidence suggests that working out before bed does not make it harder for most adults to fall asleep and may even help some get better rest.	can disrupt sleep
does sleeping with socks improve quality of sleep	believe it or not, in addition to improving sleep, wearing socks to bed could boost your sex life as well. one research study found that 80% of couples who wore socks achieved orgasm from sex, compared to the 50% previously studied without socks. while more research needs to be done, it's clear that increasing blood flow and skin temperature helps people achieve orgasm. raynaud's syndrome involves a tight restriction of small arteries in the hands and feet, often due to exposure to cold. wearing socks to bed can help stave off the cold, especially during winter, and might help prevent you from experiencing raynaud's syndrome symptoms.	could boost your sex life
what is considered as good sleep?	as humans, we feel our best when we've had a good seven to nine hours of shuteye. what feels like a reasonable amount to us is excessive to much of the animal kingdom. sure, lions and koalas can snooze for hours on end, but many animals sleep very little. in fact, some animals sleep so little that they would consider your afternoon power nap to be a full night's sleep. why do some animals sleep less than others? there are exceptions to every rule, but in general, large animals tend to sleep fewer hours than smaller ones.	afternoon power nap
what is obstructive sleep apnea?	do you find yourself tossing and turning, snoring, with difficulty breathing at night? it's estimated that obstructive sleep apnea affects between 2-9% of adults in the united states, though the majority of cases go undiagnosed. many people who suffer from obstructive sleep apnea (osa) awake not feeling rested from the night before, which can snowball into additional unwanted side effects. while obstructive sleep apnea is typically a long-term disease, it can be managed through a wide variety of treatments. on this page, we'll walk you through what obstructive sleep apnea is, including common symptoms and causes, with information to learn more about diagnosis and treatment.	a long-term disease
covid has forced my whole family to stay at home all day and i only have free time after 10pm to do my own things like schoolwork and self-care, but i can't sleep past 7 am as my family will wake me up and i'm constantly tired as a result. do you have any sleep tips to help me better the problem?	when i'm not rested, i'm grumpy, crabby, and generally unpleasant. and, like her mom, my little girl is, too - but i had lost sight of that before a wearable helped me remember. although we received a lot of new information from the wearable, we did not change much in my daughter's schedule - no cancelled weekend movie nights in favor of sleep on the weekends, for sure. she needs to be a kid and have those cheating-the-system moments! what this experiment really helped me understand, however, is how significantly sleep impacts her every day. it also taught me how to approach her during an off-day.	no cancelled weekend movie nights in favor of sleep on the weekends
what kind of music is good for sleep?	if you stick to healthy, nutrient-rich foods, you'll find it easier to stick to your intermittent fasting schedule. opt for whole foods, fruits, vegetables, and healthy proteins and fats. as a bonus, the foods that are good for your diet are good for your sleep, too. as with any change in routine, it takes a few days to adjust to intermittent fasting. allow yourself some flexibility as you figure out a schedule that works for you. fasting for eight hours might be easier than 12, or you may prefer to lower your caloric intake a few days of the week. be kind to yourself and do what works for you. by eating on a regular schedule, you may find yourself sleeping on a regular schedule more easily. consult your doctor before beginning an intermittent fasting practice, especially if you are pregnant or have a health condition.	foods that are good for your diet
what is the best environment to sleep?	a noisy environment can disrupt sleep and increase the risk of long-term health effects. the world health organization recommends keeping environmental noise levels below 40 decibels at night. unfortunately, depending on where you live, it may be impossible to ensure a sufficiently quiet bedroom environment. there is growing interest in using sounds such as music and white noise to reduce the effects of environmental noise. using sound to improve sleep is an easy, low-cost method with few known side effects. research so far demonstrates that certain sounds may help people relax for sleep and improve sleep quality, so it's worth examining how to do so, as well as what sounds work best for sleep.	bedroom
i feel stress when i need to sleep early whenever i need to wake up early the next day. how do i overcome the anxiousness that inhibits my sleep time	tracking my own sleep and movement is incredibly helpful in informing my day's activities. for example, i use data from my wearable to determine if i should push a little harder during my daily workout, or if i need to take it easier. plus, i truly appreciate the reminder to start winding down for sleep. i wondered if my daughter's experience would be the same. my daughter is like a typical nine-year-old, but with more energy. she's bright and bubbly some days, crabby and moody others, i asked if she thought it'd be fun if we strapped a wearable to her wrist 24/7.	tracking my own sleep and movement
what is considered good sleep quality?	the best mattress size for you depends on your room size, budget, and whether you sleep alone or with a partner, child, or pet. we'll describe each of the standard mattress sizes, including twin, twin xl, full/double, queen, king, and california king. most major mattress brands carry their popular models in every standard size, though some have more limited options. the exact dimensions may vary slightly between models, as does mattress thickness. now that you've narrowed down what you want in a mattress, you can start considering brands. choosing a reputable company with a good track record of product quality and customer service can simplify the process and increase your odds of having a positive experience.	product quality
doesn't alcohol help me to sleep better?	many of us have indulged in a glass of wine to help send us off to bed, and more than 1 in 10 people uses alcohol to beat stress-related insomnia and sleep better at night. however, the bulk of the evidence shows that alcohol doesn't improve sleep. on the contrary, as alcohol passes through the body, it exerts a number of biochemical effects that tend to lead to poorer sleep. understanding the effects of alcohol on sleep is the first step toward preventing alcohol-related sleep problems. although consuming alcohol before bedtime helps you fall asleep faster, the popular beverage negatively affects overall sleep quality.	alcohol doesn't improve sleep
how to improve the condition of narcolepsy?	it is triggered by strong emotions, usually positive ones like laughter. narcolepsy type 2 (nt2) does not involve cataplexy but shares many other symptoms with nt1. because narcolepsy can have profound day-to-day consequences, treatment is typically recommended to improve overall wellness. understanding the goals of treatment, the types of therapies, and their potential benefits and downsides can help people with narcolepsy work with their doctors to receive the most out of their medical care. narcolepsy is not curable. it is considered to be a lifelong condition. for the majority of patients, symptoms stay relatively stable over time.	treatment is typically recommended to improve overall wellness
what can i do to help me sleep through the night better?	after sleeping well, her energy level was high, and her activity level was there to meet it. we had a much happier, livelier, and, frankly, easier-to-live-with child, who cheerily jumped into conversation as quickly as she did the trampoline. it was obvious i did not have to push her to be physically active during these days, as she would be the one pushing me! over a matter of weeks, i was able to generally predict what my daughter's day was going to look like by checking her sleep score when she woke up. it became easier to understand how she was feeling, anticipate bumps in the day, identify what potential triggers might be, and more comfortably help her navigate through to bedtime.	navigate through to bedtime
what kind of foods affect sleep quality?	it has been well established that high-carbohydrate meals often can make you feel drowsy. high-carbohydrate meals can also impair your sleep quality. in fact, high carbohydrate intake has been shown to increase the number of awakenings at night and reduce the amount of deep sleep you get. it is not a surprise that frequent consumption of energy drinks and sugar-sweetened beverages is associated with poor sleep quality. many different types of diets can offer this kind of nutritional balance, and some have been evaluated more closely for how they affect sleep. for example, the mediterranean diet, which is plant-based while incorporating lean meats and high-fiber foods, has been found to improve heart health and sleep quality.	high-carbohydrate meals
how to improve sleep	this means that parents shouldn't be surprised if their child has a sleep regression at six months or if their sleep stays the same or shows signs of improvement at this age. how long these symptoms occur can vary significantly for any infant. usually symptoms of a six-month sleep regression don't last for very long, especially if parents implement healthy sleep tips. sleep problems often resolve within a few days or weeks, although a plateau in sleep improvements may continue for longer. when a six-month sleep regression occurs, it's an opportunity for parents to review how they approach their child's sleep.	parents implement healthy sleep tips
what determines whether someone is a light or heavy sleeper?	researchers still do not know what makes someone a light sleeper or heavy sleeper. genetics, an underlying sleep disorder, or aspects of the bedroom environment can all contribute. people who are light sleepers can wake up to small disturbances like a car passing by or a street lamp turning on. heavy sleepers, on the other hand, need something much more stimulating to wake up, like a blaring alarm clock. the differences in sensitivity to these stimuli are due to what doctors call an arousal threshold. an arousal threshold describes how strong a stimulus must be to wake you up.	genetics, an underlying sleep disorder, or aspects of the bedroom environment
what lighting is most suitable for sleeping conditions?	parents should also be aware that melatonin may decrease blood pressure or serum glucose levels. children taking other medications or who have illnesses affecting these systems should consult their doctor before starting melatonin. melatonin should only be used for children under the guidance of a doctor. most pediatric sleep disorders can be managed with behavioral changes, such as proper sleep hygiene and cognitive therapy. melatonin should not be used before trying other measures. while melatonin is largely viewed as safe, it is not without risk. perhaps the most significant risk is what we don't know about this supplement. while you're unlikely to cause any serious damage using melatonin, it's best to proceed with caution. seeing a doctor for an accurate diagnosis of a sleep condition and determining whether melatonin is suitable for your situation can save you precious time and energy.	melatonin
can i catch up on sleep during the weekends?	the size of your sleep debt determines how long it takes you to catch up on sleep. many people accumulate such a large sleep debt during the week that they would practically have to sleep all weekend to pay it back. when we fail to fully make up our sleep debt over the weekend, it carries over into the next workweek. interestingly, many people report feeling completely fine after a weekend of catching up on sleep, even though their bodies show markers of increased stress. researchers suggest that the lack of discomfort we feel after receiving catch-up sleep might explain why we keep relying on this age-old method despite its drawbacks.	when we fail to fully make up our sleep debt over the weekend
is it the longer you sleep, the less tired feeling you have?	older adults may need only six hours of sleep while other people, such as athletes, may need an extra hour of sleep. occasionally you may require more sleep than normal, such as after strenuous activity or travel. if another hour of shuteye helps you feel your best, then that amount of sleep is right for your body. if consistently sleeping longer still leaves you tired or even nodding off during the day, it may be a sign of an underlying health issue. oversleeping can occur when you try to make up for your sleep debt. for example, you may have to stay up late several nights in a row to complete a big project and therefore become sleep deprived.	if consistently sleeping longer still leaves you tired
can my mattress affect the quality of my sleep?	tracking my own sleep and movement is incredibly helpful in informing my day's activities. for example, i use data from my wearable to determine if i should push a little harder during my daily workout, or if i need to take it easier. plus, i truly appreciate the reminder to start winding down for sleep. i wondered if my daughter's experience would be the same. my daughter is like a typical nine-year-old, but with more energy. she's bright and bubbly some days, crabby and moody others, i asked if she thought it'd be fun if we strapped a wearable to her wrist 24/7.	tracking my own sleep and movement is incredibly helpful
why does food affect my sleep?	it's out in the open your hamstring hurts, let's talk about it so we can figure out we need to do something. but we don't sometimes talk about sleep in meaningful ways. so my hope is this book creates a conversation about it, because i don't think we can talk about it too much. and so when you're out with your friends, and you're talking about, my kid does this in his sleep and i read something about that one time, my hope is that this gets people talking, and moving in directions of finding that solution.	when you're out with your friends
will taking supplements e.g. valerian root, magnesium help with my sleep?	after analyzing 60 research studies published over nearly 40 years, researchers determined that valerian root can likely improve sleep and reduce anxiety in many people. valerian root supplements have been found to help people fall asleep faster, improve their sleep quality, and spend more time in a deep sleep stage. however, some studies found that valerian root had no effect or a statistically insignificant effect. to see improvement, people might have to take valerian root regularly, rather than once in a while or as needed. one thing to keep in mind is that the american academy of sleep medicine (aasm) advises against the use of natural sleep aids, including valerian root and melatonin, when treating chronic insomnia, due to the lack of evidence for their effectiveness and safety.	valerian root supplements have been found to help people fall asleep faster
how does studies and sleep co-related to each other?	not only does this study debunk the theory that your pet is disrupting your sleep, it also suggests that those co-sleeping with pets often reported higher perceived sleep quality. children may view their pets as close friends or trusted companions, seeking comfort from them while sleeping. it's possible that children and dogs may even fall into similar rem cycles, since mammals dream just like humans do. this study not only challenges prior assumptions about pet co-sleeping, but it proves that it could have long-term benefits. these benefits vary across children, and variables exist in each case-some of which are the type of pet and attachment level between the animal and child.	higher perceived sleep quality
is music good for sleeping?	music is a powerful art form. while it may get more credit for inspiring people to dance, it also offers a simple way to improve sleep hygiene, improving your ability to fall asleep quickly and feel more rested. music can aid sleep by helping you feel relaxed and at ease. with streaming apps and portable speakers, it's easier than ever to take advantage of the power of music wherever you go. given music's accessibility and potential sleep benefits, it might be a good time to try adding it to your nightly routine. parents know from experience that lullabies and gentle rhythms can help babies to fall asleep.	music can aid sleep
why do i wake up from some naps tired and not for other naps?	a brief nap can be refreshing and restorative, especially if you are sleep deprived, but longer naps late in the day can negatively impact your sleep quality and duration. a primary key to taking a successful nap comes down to timing. for most people, the ideal nap lasts 10 to 20 minutes. studies have also shown the best time to take a nap is in the early to mid-afternoon, when most people experience a natural decline in energy and alertness. homeostatic sleep pressure, also known as your sleep drive, is a reason why you feel energized after waking up and gradually become more tired as the day progresses.	homeostatic sleep pressure
what kind of exercise is good for good quality of sleep?	among that survey's respondents, about 52% said they exercised three or more times per week and 24% said they exercised less than once a week. respondents in the latter group were more likely to sleep less than six hours per night, experience fair or poor sleep quality, struggle with falling and staying asleep, and receiving a diagnosis for a sleep disorder such as insomnia, sleep apnea, or restless legs syndrome. the 2013 sleep in america poll, which surveyed adults between the ages of 23 and 60 and focused on exercise and sleep, produced similar results. roughly 76-83% of respondents who engage in light, moderate, or vigorous exercise reported very good or fairly good sleep quality.	light, moderate, or vigorous
what is the nap duration to take to ensure that i do not mess up with my circadian rhythm?	she agreed and even seemed excited. i hoped this at-home experiment would provide insight into what her day was going to look like. could we predict her next day according to her daily sleep scores, sleep graphs, and daily energy output? in our home, we have strict nighttime routines, complete with timepoints for activities like brushing teeth, ensuring we abide by bedtime. because i am hyper-aware of sleep routines, proper sleep hygiene, and what stages of my sleep cycle i should be in throughout the night and when, i wondered if i could apply the data gathered by a wearable to my daughter.	throughout the night
how to improve symptoms of restless legs syndrome?	restless legs syndrome (rls), otherwise known as willis-ekbom disease, is a disorder characterized by uncomfortable tingling sensations and an irresistible urge to move the legs. symptoms appear to follow the circadian rhythm, usually getting worse at night and often interfering with sleep. restless legs syndrome treatment aims to reduce discomfort from symptoms and improve sleep quality. while rls symptoms may never fully go away, they can be significantly improved through a combination of lifestyle changes, vitamin and mineral supplements, medical devices, and medication. when treating rls, doctors must consider the severity of the condition and the extent to which it affects your quality of life.	lifestyle changes, vitamin and mineral supplements, medical devices, and medication
what food promotes sleep	diet and sleep are closely linked, and the circadian clock that guides your sleep-wake cycle also regulates your appetite. what you consume on a given day can play a pivotal role in how well you sleep that night. certain foods and beverages contain vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and other nutrients that promote feelings of relaxation and sleepiness before bedtime. if you struggle with falling or staying asleep, then incorporating these items into your diet may help mitigate your nightly issues. we discuss what to consume and what not to consume for better sleep. researchers have pinpointed several foods that contain vitamins, minerals, and macronutrients that are beneficial for sleep.	vitamins, minerals, and macronutrients that are beneficial for sleep
is it okay to take caffeinated products in the late afternoon?	coffee and many types of tea contain caffeine. caffeine is generally safe in moderate quantities but can be harmful in excess or when consumed late in the day. drinking coffee in the afternoon or evening can also negatively impact sleep. caffeine sensitivity varies from person to person. in general, it's best to avoid caffeine for at least six hours before your planned bedtime to prevent sleep problems. earlier in the day, caffeine may provide a useful pick-me-up to counteract daytime sleepiness related to jet lag or travel fatigue; however, it's important not to rely on caffeine at the expense of sufficient nightly sleep.	it's important
how do i fall asleep easier if i suffer from insomnia?	fortunately, effective treatments are available that can help people fall asleep faster, stay asleep, and feel more rested during the day. cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (cbt-i or cbti) is a short, structured, and evidence-based approach to combating the frustrating symptoms of insomnia. cbt-i focuses on exploring the connection between the way we think, the things we do, and how we sleep. during treatment, a trained cbt-i provider helps to identify thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that are contributing to the symptoms of insomnia. thoughts and feelings about sleep are examined and tested to see if they're accurate, while behaviors are examined to determine if they promote sleep.	effective treatments
why does insomnia occur?	a third condition known as other insomnia may be diagnosed if the patient does not meet the criteria for short-term insomnia but nonetheless exhibits insomnia symptoms. the cause of a person's insomnia symptoms is also crucial to their diagnosis. primary insomnia occurs independently, while secondary insomnia is usually attributed to an underlying medical or psychological condition that causes sleep loss. primary and secondary insomnia share the same symptoms. however, treatment for secondary insomnia will typically also address the patient's underlying condition. while insomnia may arise from an underlying problem or be a primary condition, people are more susceptible to insomnia symptoms based on certain risk factors.	sleep loss
is there a relation between stress and sleep?	one study of toddlers found that those who faced stressful events were more likely to have sleep bruxism. for school-age children, bruxism may be a way of coping with the stress of homework, chores, and getting good grades. researchers have found higher levels of self-reported stress as well as stress-related hormones in people with sleep bruxism, though additional studies have failed to replicate these findings. though research is inconclusive, there is some evidence of a link between anxiety levels and sleep bruxism in children. children who are naturally restless and who worry more about doing well in school appear more likely to engage in bruxism.	there is some evidence of a link between anxiety levels and sleep bruxism
the recommended sleep duration is 7-9 hours. what happens if i sleep less than 7 hours on average?	learn more about each of these components of a healthy sleep pattern below. getting a healthy amount of sleep is a key part of a good sleep pattern. the national sleep foundation recommends that most adults get between 7 and 9 hours of sleep each night and that older adults over 65 years of age get between 7 and 8 hours. the rapid growth and development of youth means that children need additional hours of sleep, with specific recommendations varying by age. babies might need up to 17 hours per night, while the range for teens is 8 to 10 hours.	older adults over 65 years of age get between 7 and 8 hours.
is the 10 minutes snooze beneficial to human body?	it's important to find a bedroom temperature that's comfortable for you, but most people sleep best in a room in the mid-60s fahrenheit. data from surveys and research studies indicates that even vigorous exercise at night does not usually affect sleep. in fact, working out at night helps many people sleep better. that said, for some people, it may not be beneficial to do extremely intense workouts immediately before going to bed as this may make it hard for your body to relax and settle into sleep. the snooze bar can provide what seems like precious minutes to keep sleeping between alarms, but this time is unlikely to offer meaningful rest.	this time is unlikely to offer meaningful rest.
can one ever have too much sleep?	and that's where, as a parent, you can really struggle. i think that with parents, understand that your kid's going to do what he needs to do and you're not going to really screw that up. we don't have as much control over the situation as one might think. a lot of times in sleep, we talk in averages. eight hours of sleep. great. eight hours of sleep is probably a pretty good number for the average individual. but if you've ever looked at the bell curve distribution of sleep need in an adult, not to mention a child, it's quite vast.	if you've ever looked at the bell curve distribution of sleep need
does sleeping in the afternoon have negative effects?	examining your sleep, diet, exercise, and other lifestyle elements can help you determine what's causing you to feel the effects of an afternoon slump. once you know what's behind your afternoon tiredness, you can figure out how to prevent it. while there are several potential causes for the afternoon slump, the following actions may help prevent you from becoming tired and groggy in the afternoon. in addition to in-the-moment actions that help you avoid an afternoon slump, consider more substantial lifestyle changes that could have far-reaching impacts. these steps can help you feel more alert in the afternoon and improve your overall sleep quality.	may help prevent you from becoming tired and groggy in the afternoon
if i wear glasses that blocks blue light, does that mean using electronic devices right before bed will not have any impact on my sleep?	blue-light-blocking glasses support melatonin production during the third trimester of pregnancy and help pregnant people sleep, according to a new study. the study focused on norwegian women who had not given birth previously. the pregnant study participants wore blue-light-blocking glasses for three hours before bedtime as well as any time they were exposed to light during the night. researchers found that wearing blue-light-blocking glasses led to earlier production of melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate sleep-wake cycles and promotes sleep. the study found that melatonin production began an average of 45 minutes earlier in the group that wore the blue-light-blocking glasses before bed, compared to their melatonin onset before the study.	melatonin

what is the optimum number of hours to sleep before an exam for a university student?	from elementary school to graduate school, routine testing is often the standard for evaluating academic performance and achievement. according to one study, an american student takes as many as 112 tests by the end of their senior year of high school. quizzes, unit tests, midterms, and finals are hallmarks of education, and the stakes get higher as grade levels rise. high school and college students may have to prepare for a number of standardized tests: the sat, act, toefl, gre, lsat, mcat, to name just a few. given how much importance schools and colleges place on tests, it's no wonder that students may be tempted to stay up late to cram before a big exam.	cram
i'm currently on a diet. will that affect my sleep?	when i'm not rested, i'm grumpy, crabby, and generally unpleasant. and, like her mom, my little girl is, too - but i had lost sight of that before a wearable helped me remember. although we received a lot of new information from the wearable, we did not change much in my daughter's schedule - no cancelled weekend movie nights in favor of sleep on the weekends, for sure. she needs to be a kid and have those cheating-the-system moments! what this experiment really helped me understand, however, is how significantly sleep impacts her every day. it also taught me how to approach her during an off-day.	sleep impacts her every day
how can sleep affect my motivation?	using a wearable can help us pay attention and make small adjustments to daily practices, like sticking to a bedtime routine. these adjustments can enormously impact our moods, attitudes, and cognitive function. using a wearable has helped me gain insight into and improve my sleep routines. my experience prompted me to wonder, if sleep-tracking wearables help adults make positive lifestyle adjustments, would sleep tracking be beneficial for children, too? as the editor-in-chief of sleep foundation, i eat, breathe, and sleep sleep! for this reason, i felt excited to see how a sleep-tracking wearable might impact my nine-year-old daughter.	enormously impact our moods, attitudes, and cognitive function
should i abstain from eating dinner to improve sleep?	studies have found that eating within three hours of your bedtime increases the likelihood of sleep disruptions, and that risk may be even greater if you overeat at dinner. acid reflux, which is more likely with a late dinner, can further reduce sleep quality. beyond its impact on your sleep, eating before bed may also contribute to weight gain. the body's internal clock, known as its circadian rhythm, empowers the body to better digest food and regulate blood sugar during the day. in this way, a late dinner can negatively affect metabolism, increase body fat, and heighten the risk of obesity. given its potential impact on sleep and weight, studies indicate that, in general, it's preferable to consume the majority of caloric intake during the day. that said, because dietary needs can vary depending on a person's circumstances, anyone concerned about their nutrition and sleep should talk with their doctor or a nutritionist for advice that is tailored to their situation.	talk with their doctor or a nutritionist
my roommate snores. is that a sign of restful sleep or a cause of concern?	when operating on different sleep schedules, some noise at night is inevitable, but you could try agreeing upon rules for quiet hours. for example, it might help to request that your partner or roommate use headphones to listen to tv or music and refrain from talking on the phone inside while you are sleeping. planning ahead by cooking meals and laying out the next day's clothes during waking hours can also cut down on disruption. if your partner's snoring is keeping you up, talk with them about it. lifestyle changes or anti-snoring mouthpieces might help. very loud snoring and choking or gasping sounds at night could be signs of obstructive sleep apnea.	obstructive sleep apnea
what time is the optimal time to nap?	some older children may still be inclined to nap and can benefit from doing so. in a study in china, where it is often more culturally appropriate to nap, children in grades 4-6 who took frequent naps after lunch showed signs of better behavior, academic achievement, and overall happiness. the existing research about napping and optimal timing of sleep episodes is inconclusive and acknowledges that what's best for one child can change over time and may not be what's best for another child of the same age. for this reason, parents, teachers, and child care workers may be able to best encourage optimal sleep for kids by being flexible and understanding about naps.	after lunch
what is the relationship between food, alochol, and sleep?	it's common knowledge that both getting good sleep and following a healthy diet are essential for overall health. often overlooked, though, is that there is an important relationship between sleep and nutrition. a major part of that relationship is the link between sleep and overeating. sleep deprivation can affect appetite and food choices, increasing the likelihood of both overeating and consuming unhealthy foods. overeating can affect sleep as well. eating too much, especially when it involves heavy or spicy foods, can worsen sleep by interfering with digestion and raising the risk of heartburn. for this reason, most experts advise against eating too much and too close to bedtime.	nutrition
are naps good or bad?	dreams appear to be an important part of normal, healthy sleep. at the same time, though, nightmares can disrupt sleep and even affect a person during their waking hours. given that virtually everyone has dreams, both good and bad, it's natural to wonder how dreaming affects sleep quality, whether nightmares are bad for sleep, and how to avoid bad dreams. dreaming is a normal part of healthy sleep. good sleep has been connected to better cognitive function and emotional health, and studies have also linked dreams to effective thinking, memory, and emotional processing. in this way, many experts believe dreaming is either a reflection of or a contributor to quality sleep.	good
i want to use a wearable for tracking my sleep. how do wearables measure my sleep quality and quantity?	using a wearable can help us pay attention and make small adjustments to daily practices, like sticking to a bedtime routine. these adjustments can enormously impact our moods, attitudes, and cognitive function. using a wearable has helped me gain insight into and improve my sleep routines. my experience prompted me to wonder, if sleep-tracking wearables help adults make positive lifestyle adjustments, would sleep tracking be beneficial for children, too? as the editor-in-chief of sleep foundation, i eat, breathe, and sleep sleep! for this reason, i felt excited to see how a sleep-tracking wearable might impact my nine-year-old daughter.	improve my sleep routines
what time should i stop exercise to have a good quality of sleep?	heavy drinking means more than 15 drinks per week for men and more than eight drinks per week for women. will a small amount of alcohol affect my sleep? drinking to excess will probably have a more negative impact on sleep than light or moderate alcohol consumption. however, since the effects of alcohol are different from person to person, even small amounts of alcohol can reduce sleep quality for some people. one 2018 study compared sleep quality among subjects who consumed different amounts of alcohol. when should i stop drinking prior to bed to minimize sleep disruption? to reduce the risk of sleep disruptions, you should stop drinking alcohol at least four hours before bedtime.	four hours before bedtime
are there alternatives to coffee that also give the same level of wakefulness in the morning?	coffee drinking is widespread, especially in the united states. an estimated 75% of american adults drink coffee, and nearly 50% do so on a daily basis. coffee contains caffeine and other compounds that, together, increase alertness and improve mood. as a result, many people use coffee as part of their morning routines to help them feel awake and ready for the day. even though coffee is a stimulant, some people find drinking it does not give them the outcome they desire. we discuss the potential reasons coffee might seem to make you feel sleepy rather than alert, as well as what you can do to counteract these effects.	drinking it does not give them the outcome they desire
what are the type of mattresses and pillows i should use to get better quality sleep?	sf: you've mentioned the importance of keeping kids on a sleep schedule. what does a good nighttime routine look like for children? dg: it will vary according to what they enjoy. it will vary according to the type of child that they are with their age. it should be a routine with which you have got their buy-in. you want them to not be sold on the idea, but literally interested in it. it should be age-appropriate and designed for them. i think baths work well. we now know that a decrease in core temperature encourages us to get to sleep more easily.	baths
i am afraid of the dark, can i sleep with a night light on?	she agreed and even seemed excited. i hoped this at-home experiment would provide insight into what her day was going to look like. could we predict her next day according to her daily sleep scores, sleep graphs, and daily energy output? in our home, we have strict nighttime routines, complete with timepoints for activities like brushing teeth, ensuring we abide by bedtime. because i am hyper-aware of sleep routines, proper sleep hygiene, and what stages of my sleep cycle i should be in throughout the night and when, i wondered if i could apply the data gathered by a wearable to my daughter.	throughout the night
does excessive carbohydrate intake affect my sleep?	a central role of nutrition is having a high enough intake of a broad range of vitamins and minerals that enable almost all types of bodily systems and processes. growing evidence indicates that sufficient nutrient consumption is important for sleep. one large study found a lack of key nutrients, such as calcium, magnesium, and vitamins a, c, d, e, and k to be associated with sleep problems. while this research does not prove cause-and-effect, it supports the likelihood that diet affects hormonal pathways involved in sleep. high-carbohydrate meals with high glycemic indexes can also affect one's energy level and sleep quality.	can also affect one's energy level and sleep quality.
is it true that lavender scents help me to fall asleep faster?	certain scents such as lavender and peppermint show promise for their ability to reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality. to ward off stress before bedtime, try aromatherapy with essential oils or give yourself a mini foot massage with lavender cream. many people find that journaling about their worries helps them manage stress. by scheduling a set time every day to write down what's on your mind, you might be able to prevent the racing thoughts that bother you while trying to fall asleep. if traffic or noisy neighbors are making it impossible to sleep, consider masking the sound with earplugs or a white noise machine.	if traffic or noisy neighbors are making it impossible to sleep
what is sleep paralysis?	after starting in the teenage years, episodes may occur more frequently in the 20s and 30s. the exact cause of sleep paralysis is unknown. studies have examined data to see what is associated with a higher risk of sleep paralysis and have found mixed results. based on that research, researchers believe that multiple factors are involved in provoking sleep paralysis. sleep disorders and other sleeping problems have shown some of the strongest correlations with isolated sleep paralysis. higher rates of sleep paralysis - 38% in one study - are reported by people with obstructive sleep apnea (osa), a sleep disorder of repeated lapses in breathing.	the exact cause of sleep paralysis is unknown
does my gene affect how i sleep?	the conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and concision. sleep foundation (sf): thanks for your time today! i'd like to begin by discussing your background. how did you initially become interested in this field of sleep? dave gibson (dg): i had a childhood where sleep wasn't really mentioned. i had two parents - one who didn't sleep, my mother, and one who slept every time he could, which was my dad. i have my mom's sleep genes, so i have to work hard at getting to sleep. so when i look back to my history, i had poor sleep.	i had poor sleep
how effective is melatonin supplements to help me sleep?	when considering a melatonin patch, review all the ingredients with your doctor and ask them if you should expect any side effects, based on your personal medical history or other medications you may be taking. always read the instructions thoroughly before using melatonin supplements for the first time. you may find melatonin patches useful if you have trouble sleeping through the night, or if you need to sleep during the day. although more research is needed to understand how melatonin patches differ from other forms of melatonin supplements, studies suggest that the continuous release of melatonin through a transdermal sleep patch can help people stay asleep. some people find melatonin patches to be more comfortable than taking an oral supplement or using a nasal spray. although melatonin supplements are available over the counter, you may want to talk to your doctor before starting to take melatonin. they can help you weigh the benefits and drawbacks of each format to find the right fit for you.	continuous release of melatonin through a transdermal sleep patch
how long should i nap in the day?	although sleep needs vary among children, the national sleep foundation provides guidelines for how many hours babies and toddlers should sleep during each 24-hour period. if you are concerned that your baby sleeps too much or too little, contact your pediatrician. expert guidelines outline how much babies should sleep during both day and night. for this reason, how much a baby should nap largely depends on how much they sleep at night. babies should nap as many hours as needed to get sufficient sleep in a 24-hour period. for example, guidelines recommend that 6-month-olds should sleep 12 to 16 hours a day, so if they sleep eight hours at night, they should nap around four to eight hours during the day.	four to eight hours
is sleeping from 6 am- 2 pm different from sleeping from 10 pm - 6 am?	shift work sleep disorder is a circadian rhythm sleep disorder characterized by sleep problems that stem from working long or irregular hours. the term shift work refers to any work schedule that falls outside the hours of 7 am and 6 pm. while any shift worker can develop symptoms, the disorder primarily affects employees with night, early morning, or rotating shifts. if untreated, shift work disorder can lead to major health concerns. the condition may also negatively impact the worker's professional performance and put them at a higher risk of committing an error or being involved in a workplace accident.	7
i want to cut down on taking carbohydrates to lose weight but i feel like i lack energy as a result, are there any low-carb alternatives to keep me "full" and energised?	when you look at the reduction in exercise, the gain in weight, and the lack of health, the whole thing feeds together in a complex of interrelationships. but certainly when i talk to people, most people aren't getting enough sleep. even if they're not asking me for sleep advice, they're getting it. sf: why do you think it's important to speak directly to the sleep hygiene of children? dg: if you think about learning a language or any skill, when the brain's being formed, it's a lot easier to ingrain it. i don't think you can create a good night's sleep for one person within a family.	exercise
how can i maximize my efficiency if i need to study in the evening?	this wearables experience changed me, maybe more than it changed my daughter. i found myself altering how i approached her right from the beginning of the day depending on how well she slept. if she didn't sleep well or i noticed a lot of nighttime disturbances in her graph, i would allow her more leeway. giving her the benefit of doubt seemed to ease the bumps we'd hit throughout our daytime hours together, and even allow us to have a quiet and calm drift into the evening. this insight into my daughter's nine-year-old brain made me realize something so simple: we're not that much different.	quiet and calm drift
is it normal that i can sleep for more than 8 hours before naturally waking up?	adolescents also experience changes in their homeostatic sleep drive, which is the urge to sleep that grows stronger the longer someone is awake. together, these changes give teenagers a natural inclination to stay awake later at night and wake up later in the morning than children or older adults. because of high school start times, which can be before 8 o'clock in the morning, teenagers often must wake well before they have slept enough. combined with homework, jobs, social interactions, sports, and other after-school activities, it is common for teenagers to routinely fall short of the necessary amount of sleep.	teenagers often must wake well before they have slept enough
after i stay up all night, what should i do to recover as soon as possible?	certainly all the research suggests, even with teenagers, that if you set them a bedtime they are more likely to get more sleep. so even when teenagers want to rule their own lives, giving them a bedtime is the way to go. sf: the stereotype of the teenager is one who stays up late and wakes up late; their circadian rhythm just shifts later, all-around. is that something we should be mindful of, or work to correct? or is that just what our bodies do when we're adolescents? dg: i think the western world does teenage students a disservice.	work
what is the circadian rhythm	leaders are supposed to provide quiet, restful sleep environments and enable those under their command to receive eight hours whenever possible. in many ways, the conditions of serving in the military make good sleep hard to come by. it's worth noting that many service members join the military during adolescence, when the body experiences a circadian shift. our circadian rhythms regulate our sleep-wake cycles. during adolescence, our circadian rhythms shift later, so we naturally feel tired later. we also need to sleep for about nine hours, which is one hour longer than what the average adult needs.	regulate our sleep-wake cycles
should i stick to a fixed sleeping/waking time?	a sleep schedule is a daily routine consisting of fixed times for falling asleep at night and waking up in the morning. this schedule is not limited to the work week. according to sleep hygiene guidelines, people should maintain their sleep schedule on days off as well. because habits and routines often drive human behavior, people can become conditioned to a set sleep schedule through consistency and repetition. over time, the idea is that following this schedule will essentially reorient your brain and make it easier for you to stick to the routine. current research supports an association between irregular sleep schedules and lower sleep quality.	following this schedule will essentially reorient your brain and make it easier
how does sleep debt work?	short naps may help you feel more rested and finish your work day strong. most adults need approximately seven to nine hours of sleep each night. however, activities such as work, commuting, and socializing have been shown to reduce the overall amount of time people spend asleep, resulting in a sleep debt. sleep debt is the difference between how much sleep a person needs and how much they actually receive. napping is one way to reduce your sleep debt and its negative impacts. for example, a 10-minute power nap during the day may be enough to help you fight fatigue and sleepiness for up to two hours after your nap.	reduce the overall amount of time people spend asleep
do wearables help to sleep better?	using a wearable can help us pay attention and make small adjustments to daily practices, like sticking to a bedtime routine. these adjustments can enormously impact our moods, attitudes, and cognitive function. using a wearable has helped me gain insight into and improve my sleep routines. my experience prompted me to wonder, if sleep-tracking wearables help adults make positive lifestyle adjustments, would sleep tracking be beneficial for children, too? as the editor-in-chief of sleep foundation, i eat, breathe, and sleep sleep! for this reason, i felt excited to see how a sleep-tracking wearable might impact my nine-year-old daughter.	improve my sleep routines
how can sleep help with my sport performance?	in fact, good sleep habits may be even more important to kids who play sports. high quality sleep is linked to better athletic performance and fewer injuries in teens and young adults. in contrast, teenagers who do not get enough sleep are more likely to be sick or injured, and to face issues like depression and anxiety. kids who struggle to balance school, sports, and daily life also run the risk of disrupting their natural sleep cycles. we look at the importance of sleep for a student athlete, including the effects of sleep on athletic performance, and how parents can help kids and teens get enough rest to thrive and excel.	parents can help kids and teens get enough rest to thrive and excel
does taking naps influence my sleep quality?	the mslt involves giving a sleeper opportunities to take four or five daytime naps about two hours apart. researchers measure how long it takes the person to fall asleep. if the person does not fall asleep within 20 minutes, that nap is canceled and the sleep latency is recorded as 20 minutes. if the person does fall asleep, testers record brain activity for the next 15 minutes, with a special focus on whether participants reach rem stage during their naps. multiple factors can influence results of a multiple sleep latency test, including recent sleep deprivation, medication use, and activity level.	multiple factors can influence results of a multiple sleep latency test
how is the quality of sleep affect the consumption of alcohol?	when and how much you drink different beverages can affect sleep. too much fluid consumption may contribute to frequent urination at night, known as nocturia, which can disturb sleep with repeated trips to the bathroom. late night or significant consumption of alcohol or caffeine can also interfere with sleep. alcohol, coffee, tea, energy drinks, and soda can affect sleep and should be either avoided or used cautiously when traveling. if you decide to drink any of these beverages, consider both the quantity and timing of their consumption. drinking them in moderation and long before bedtime reduces their potential impact on sleep.	drinking them in moderation and long before bedtime
should i go to bed at my regularly bedtime, even if i don't feel sleepy by then on a particular day/	she agreed and even seemed excited. i hoped this at-home experiment would provide insight into what her day was going to look like. could we predict her next day according to her daily sleep scores, sleep graphs, and daily energy output? in our home, we have strict nighttime routines, complete with timepoints for activities like brushing teeth, ensuring we abide by bedtime. because i am hyper-aware of sleep routines, proper sleep hygiene, and what stages of my sleep cycle i should be in throughout the night and when, i wondered if i could apply the data gathered by a wearable to my daughter.	i should be in throughout the night and when
what is the best time to do exercise for a good sleep at night?	that said, some surveys have found the vast majority of people do not exercise in the hour before bedtime. one example is the national sleep foundation's 2005 sleep in america poll, which surveyed adults 18 and older. of these respondents, 4% said they exercised within an hour of bedtime on a nightly basis, 7% said they did so a few nights a week, and 5% said they exercised before bed a few nights per month. the remaining respondents either rarely or never exercised an hour before bedtime, or refused to answer. since survey results among people who exercise late at night have been variable, you should base your exercise times and intensity on what best suits your sleep schedule.	what best suits your sleep schedule
how does alcohol influences our sleep?	no one firmness level performs optimally for all sleepers. factors such as weight, body type, and preferred sleep position all influence what is comfortable and supportive for you. additionally, firmness is not the only performance factor to consider when choosing a mattress. other variables, such as durability, temperature neutrality, and responsiveness, can also influence overall comfort. since there is no universally accepted measurement for mattress firmness, each manufacturer may use its own system. however, a 10-point scale is common. our system can give you a clearer idea of how a mattress may feel and how the firmness compares to other models.	comfortable and supportive
how to sleep better on a plane?	back, side, and stomach sleepers each need different amounts of support and contouring to promote good sleep posture, and some mattresses perform better with certain sleep positions than others. back sleepers need a mattress that will support their body enough to keep the back on an even plane. if a mattress provides insufficient support, the hips and midsection may sag excessively into the bed and potentially result in back pain. at the same time, back sleepers need some amount of cushion to prevent pressure from building up against the spine and hips. back sleepers tend to enjoy medium firm or firm mattresses with light contouring.	a mattress
does blue light or the brightness of devices really affect sleep?	you can adapt your evening routine according to the activities that work for you, but try to establish a regular pattern of doing the same activities every night. remember to leave extra time for your routine so it does not cut into your sleep time. exposure to bright light in the evening can inhibit the secretion of melatonin, the sleep hormone, and make it difficult to fall asleep early. electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, computers, and tvs emit a particularly high-energy type of light called blue light. blue light exposure during the day is important for staying alert, but humans are especially sensitive to this high-energy light input at night, so it is best to put these devices away in the lead-up to bedtime.	blue light
how many caffeine is the recommended amount?	many people who work evening or night shifts rely on caffeine to keep them alert and refreshed. however, too much coffee or caffeinated soda can negatively affect your sleep after the shift ends. if you prefer some caffeine for evening or night shift work, we recommend a moderate amount during the first few hours of your shift. you should avoid caffeine within three to four hours of your scheduled bedtime that day. some shift workers use coffee naps for an additional kick. caffeine will take effect roughly 15 to 20 minutes after you consume it, leaving you just enough time for a refreshing nap.	moderate
what time is the most optimal time to sleep?	some older children may still be inclined to nap and can benefit from doing so. in a study in china, where it is often more culturally appropriate to nap, children in grades 4-6 who took frequent naps after lunch showed signs of better behavior, academic achievement, and overall happiness. the existing research about napping and optimal timing of sleep episodes is inconclusive and acknowledges that what's best for one child can change over time and may not be what's best for another child of the same age. for this reason, parents, teachers, and child care workers may be able to best encourage optimal sleep for kids by being flexible and understanding about naps.	after lunch
what can i do to shorten my sleep onset latency?	while our family chose the amazon halo for our experiment, there are numerous sleep trackers available that are appropriate for kids, such as the garmin vivofit jr. 2 and fitbit ace 2 and 3. the data these trackers provide can offer a new perspective on your child's daily and nightly routines and sleep quality. do i vote for every child being constantly analyzed for data? certainly not. you have to do what makes you and your family comfortable. wearables can be a gentle, fun, non-invasive way of gaining insight into your child's inner workings. and, hey, now my daughter wakes up every morning and asks, can i check my sleep score?. how much sleep do babies and kids need? do your children get enough sleep? is your child getting enough sleep? here's how to tell.	check my sleep score
how can i work towards better sleep?	the centers for disease control and prevention report that 30% of working adults receive less than six hours of sleep each night on average. this amount is well below expert guidelines, which recommend that adults obtain between seven and nine hours of sleep per night. you may be able to make up for an all-nighter with a power nap or a weekend sleep-in, but those who regularly go short on sleep can rack up a sleep debt that's more difficult to recover from. understanding how to catch up on sleep is the first step toward feeling better.	understanding how to catch up on sleep
why do some people require a lot of sleep while others can get by on less?	you know why would that be? one theory could be, maybe that child is excessively sleepy, and you've made him less so with that medication. i think back to when my first child was born. we came home, we put her in that little chair that kind of bounces. it's got a little angle, and i remember sitting there and we looked at each other like, well, god now what? we're pretty smart people. but i think when it comes to sleep and our kids, we don't really get a lot of instruction. it's something we talk a lot about, but not in ways that might be particularly helpful for parents.	we don't really get a lot of instruction
why would some people feel guilty when sleeping for a very long time?	as humans, we feel our best when we've had a good seven to nine hours of shuteye. what feels like a reasonable amount to us is excessive to much of the animal kingdom. sure, lions and koalas can snooze for hours on end, but many animals sleep very little. in fact, some animals sleep so little that they would consider your afternoon power nap to be a full night's sleep. why do some animals sleep less than others? there are exceptions to every rule, but in general, large animals tend to sleep fewer hours than smaller ones.	some animals sleep less than others
how do i motivate myself to sleep earlier?	this wearables experience changed me, maybe more than it changed my daughter. i found myself altering how i approached her right from the beginning of the day depending on how well she slept. if she didn't sleep well or i noticed a lot of nighttime disturbances in her graph, i would allow her more leeway. giving her the benefit of doubt seemed to ease the bumps we'd hit throughout our daytime hours together, and even allow us to have a quiet and calm drift into the evening. this insight into my daughter's nine-year-old brain made me realize something so simple: we're not that much different.	how well she slept
my friends drinks often in hall and i couldn't help to join them due to peer pressure but i feel very hung over the following day, what should i do?	tracking my own sleep and movement is incredibly helpful in informing my day's activities. for example, i use data from my wearable to determine if i should push a little harder during my daily workout, or if i need to take it easier. plus, i truly appreciate the reminder to start winding down for sleep. i wondered if my daughter's experience would be the same. my daughter is like a typical nine-year-old, but with more energy. she's bright and bubbly some days, crabby and moody others, i asked if she thought it'd be fun if we strapped a wearable to her wrist 24/7.	push a little harder during my daily workout
how do i make myself fall asleep faster?	fortunately, effective treatments are available that can help people fall asleep faster, stay asleep, and feel more rested during the day. cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (cbt-i or cbti) is a short, structured, and evidence-based approach to combating the frustrating symptoms of insomnia. cbt-i focuses on exploring the connection between the way we think, the things we do, and how we sleep. during treatment, a trained cbt-i provider helps to identify thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that are contributing to the symptoms of insomnia. thoughts and feelings about sleep are examined and tested to see if they're accurate, while behaviors are examined to determine if they promote sleep.	effective treatments
coffee puts me to sleep, can i drink it at night?	sleep deprivation, caffeine tolerance, dehydration, adenosine levels, blood sugar changes, or individual differences in caffeine metabolism may cause you to feel tired after drinking coffee. more than one-third of americans are sleep-deprived and not receiving the recommended minimum of seven hours of sleep per night. although coffee can provide a quick pick-me-up, it is not an adequate substitute for sleep. sleep deprivation can reduce alertness, slow down response times, and negatively affect thinking. drinking more coffee in an effort to overcome tiredness might backfire. ingesting too much caffeine can negatively impact sleep, making you sleepy the next day.	not an adequate substitute for sleep
how much should i sleep	and i think the problem that we've got is, how do you cope with that body clock shift? you can't. you can't get a teenager to go to bed at 9:00. it's just not physically possible, because the melatonin isn't being secreted then. so then you look at the weekend. should you let them catch up on sleep? yes. how much? maximum two hours. does that mean they've got a sleep debt? yes, if they've knocked two hours off their recommended sleep each school night - which a lot of teenagers do - teenagers should be sleeping between eight to ten hours each night.	maximum two hours
is sleep important?	online or in-person support groups can help people with narcolepsy connect with others with the disease. check-ins with a mental health counselor can prevent, identify, and treat mood and anxiety disorders. eating a healthy diet is important for everyone, but it takes on added importance for people with narcolepsy because they have an elevated risk of obesity. the timing of meals is important as well. eating too late at night may interfere with normal digestion and is associated with sleep disruptions. if late dinners or snacks are heavy or spicy, they may cause acid reflux or indigestion that can worsen sleep quality.	eating too late at night may interfere with normal digestion
what time should i stop drinking coffee to have a good sleep?	heavy drinking means more than 15 drinks per week for men and more than eight drinks per week for women. will a small amount of alcohol affect my sleep? drinking to excess will probably have a more negative impact on sleep than light or moderate alcohol consumption. however, since the effects of alcohol are different from person to person, even small amounts of alcohol can reduce sleep quality for some people. one 2018 study compared sleep quality among subjects who consumed different amounts of alcohol. when should i stop drinking prior to bed to minimize sleep disruption? to reduce the risk of sleep disruptions, you should stop drinking alcohol at least four hours before bedtime.	four hours before bedtime
what happens if i do not sleep for more than 24 hours?	oversleeping, or sleeping for over nine hours in a night, happens for many reasons. maybe you oversleep because you're fighting off an illness, or you're catching up after a few nights of sleep deprivation. however, consistently oversleeping may be the sign of a sleep disorder, mental health disorder, or other health issue. we cover how oversleeping is defined, the various issues that cause oversleeping, and what you can do if you tend to oversleep. oversleeping, or long sleeping, is defined as sleeping more than nine hours in a 24-hour period. hypersomnia describes a condition in which you both oversleep and experience excessive sleepiness during the day.	oversleeping
is there any way to optimise my sleep?	it's out in the open your hamstring hurts, let's talk about it so we can figure out we need to do something. but we don't sometimes talk about sleep in meaningful ways. so my hope is this book creates a conversation about it, because i don't think we can talk about it too much. and so when you're out with your friends, and you're talking about, my kid does this in his sleep and i read something about that one time, my hope is that this gets people talking, and moving in directions of finding that solution.	my kid does this in his sleep
my roommate keeps sleeping at 7am everyday, how can i get him to sleep earlier.	you know why would that be? one theory could be, maybe that child is excessively sleepy, and you've made him less so with that medication. i think back to when my first child was born. we came home, we put her in that little chair that kind of bounces. it's got a little angle, and i remember sitting there and we looked at each other like, well, god now what? we're pretty smart people. but i think when it comes to sleep and our kids, we don't really get a lot of instruction. it's something we talk a lot about, but not in ways that might be particularly helpful for parents.	we don't really get a lot of instruction
what types of food to consume that could help me sleep better?	diet and sleep are closely linked, and the circadian clock that guides your sleep-wake cycle also regulates your appetite. what you consume on a given day can play a pivotal role in how well you sleep that night. certain foods and beverages contain vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and other nutrients that promote feelings of relaxation and sleepiness before bedtime. if you struggle with falling or staying asleep, then incorporating these items into your diet may help mitigate your nightly issues. we discuss what to consume and what not to consume for better sleep. researchers have pinpointed several foods that contain vitamins, minerals, and macronutrients that are beneficial for sleep.	vitamins, minerals, and macronutrients
i often look at my phone after turning off the lights. will this have a bad effect on my sleep?	the conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and concision. sleep foundation (sf): thanks for your time today! i'd like to begin by discussing your background. how did you initially become interested in this field of sleep? dave gibson (dg): i had a childhood where sleep wasn't really mentioned. i had two parents - one who didn't sleep, my mother, and one who slept every time he could, which was my dad. i have my mom's sleep genes, so i have to work hard at getting to sleep. so when i look back to my history, i had poor sleep.	i had poor sleep
how do you know if you had a good night's rest?	this hormone helps children grow and repairs cells and tissues in both children and adults. additionally, a good night's sleep helps the immune system defend against infections, which may explain why getting plenty of sleep keeps you healthy and also allows you to recover if you do become ill. the good news is that you can promote better sleep by creating a constructive bedtime routine and establishing excellent sleep hygiene. there's a lot of information about what to do before bedtime to get a good night's rest, but it's equally important to know what not to do.	it's equally important to know what not to do
is it okay for adults to nap in the afternoon?	if the heat makes you tired, avoid the worst of it by staying inside during the hottest parts of the day. avoiding the hottest times is especially important if you are going outside to exercise. try to time your outdoor activities so you can enjoy the sun during cooler times such as the morning, the late afternoon, or the evening. during heat waves or in places with extremely humid weather, try to seek out air-conditioned spaces. when sleepiness has more to do with the time of day than the temperature, an afternoon nap might help. a short 10- to 20-minute nap taken during the afternoon slump can increase alertness. loose, long-sleeved shirts and pants, as well as sunscreen reapplied throughout the day, can help protect you from a sunburn. know what to look out for so you can act in time to prevent heat illness. be extra careful in the heat if you are a child, athlete, or older adult. additionally, you should use caution if you have a pre-existing medical condition or take certain medications.	might help
what sleep routine should i have to sleep better?	she agreed and even seemed excited. i hoped this at-home experiment would provide insight into what her day was going to look like. could we predict her next day according to her daily sleep scores, sleep graphs, and daily energy output? in our home, we have strict nighttime routines, complete with timepoints for activities like brushing teeth, ensuring we abide by bedtime. because i am hyper-aware of sleep routines, proper sleep hygiene, and what stages of my sleep cycle i should be in throughout the night and when, i wondered if i could apply the data gathered by a wearable to my daughter.	throughout the night and when
are there any specific forms of exercise i should avoid before i sleep?	i can't imagine why that's not common practice in all universities. it should be absolutely spoon fed to children and university graduates, because it's a no-brainer. it's now proven that children who get better sleep get better results in exams. i approach health from all different angles, so i get people coming to me either for a specific health need or a global intervention. and it's interesting when you look at the things that are components of health. you can't get away from exercise, sleep, and food. and they all crossover and interconnect. when you look at the rise in obesity and the decrease in sleep, they're pretty much interlinked, too.	you can't get away from exercise, sleep, and food
what kinds of food are good for sleep?	if you stick to healthy, nutrient-rich foods, you'll find it easier to stick to your intermittent fasting schedule. opt for whole foods, fruits, vegetables, and healthy proteins and fats. as a bonus, the foods that are good for your diet are good for your sleep, too. as with any change in routine, it takes a few days to adjust to intermittent fasting. allow yourself some flexibility as you figure out a schedule that works for you. fasting for eight hours might be easier than 12, or you may prefer to lower your caloric intake a few days of the week. be kind to yourself and do what works for you. by eating on a regular schedule, you may find yourself sleeping on a regular schedule more easily. consult your doctor before beginning an intermittent fasting practice, especially if you are pregnant or have a health condition.	foods that are good for your diet
what makes a conducive sleeping environment?	the connections between smell and sleep are subject to continuing research, but knowing about what has been discovered so far provides opportunities to make your bedroom environment more conducive to quality sleep. your sense of smell is part of a complicated olfactory system. special cells in the nose, called olfactory neurons, receive chemical signals from all kinds of compounds in our environment. these neurons are directly connected to the brain, allowing for rapid identification of smells based on which neurons are stimulated. scents can reach neurons through the nostrils or from the back of the throat, which is part of why taste and smell are intricately connected.	knowing about what has been discovered
is it important for me to have a fixed bedtime?	coffee and many types of tea contain caffeine. caffeine is generally safe in moderate quantities but can be harmful in excess or when consumed late in the day. drinking coffee in the afternoon or evening can also negatively impact sleep. caffeine sensitivity varies from person to person. in general, it's best to avoid caffeine for at least six hours before your planned bedtime to prevent sleep problems. earlier in the day, caffeine may provide a useful pick-me-up to counteract daytime sleepiness related to jet lag or travel fatigue; however, it's important not to rely on caffeine at the expense of sufficient nightly sleep.	it's important not to rely on caffeine
how long should an athelete sleep everyday?	you may need to experiment with multiple listenings to determine how long of a track you need to induce sleepiness. when listening to binaural beats, make sure you have sound entering each ear. you can wear headphones or earbuds, whichever is more comfortable. if you lose sound in one ear, you will not hear the binaural beats created independently by the brain. currently, only a few negative side effects of using binaural beats have been reported. some listeners report irritability or frustration while listening to the beats. to prevent this discomfort, researchers suggest tracks with additional sounds, such as white noise. additionally, long-term exposure to sound at 85 decibels or higher can result in hearing loss. examples of everyday sounds at that level or above are motorcycles, concerts, sporting events, and listening to music at full volume through headphones. as you listen to binaural beats, be sure the volume is not too high.	how long
where can i go to seek medical help for my persistent sleep issues?	the conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and concision. sleep foundation (sf): thanks for your time today! i'd like to begin by discussing your background. how did you initially become interested in this field of sleep? dave gibson (dg): i had a childhood where sleep wasn't really mentioned. i had two parents - one who didn't sleep, my mother, and one who slept every time he could, which was my dad. i have my mom's sleep genes, so i have to work hard at getting to sleep. so when i look back to my history, i had poor sleep.	sleep foundation
is blue light bad for our sleep?	light is the most important factor in aligning circadian rhythms and, for much of human history, these rhythms were closely aligned with sunrise and sunset. with the advent of artificial light and electronics, people are being exposed to increasing amounts of light before bedtime. while all types of visible light can affect circadian rhythms, blue light has the largest impact. we get the most of our exposure to blue light from the sun. blue light stimulates parts of the brain that make us feel alert, elevating our body temperature and heart rate. during the day, blue light can improve performance and attention, tuning our circadian rhythm and setting us up for a better night's sleep after the sun sets.	setting us up for a better night's sleep after the sun sets.
what is the optimal nap time?	some older children may still be inclined to nap and can benefit from doing so. in a study in china, where it is often more culturally appropriate to nap, children in grades 4-6 who took frequent naps after lunch showed signs of better behavior, academic achievement, and overall happiness. the existing research about napping and optimal timing of sleep episodes is inconclusive and acknowledges that what's best for one child can change over time and may not be what's best for another child of the same age. for this reason, parents, teachers, and child care workers may be able to best encourage optimal sleep for kids by being flexible and understanding about naps.	sleep
why is rem sleep better than deep sleep?	disrupted sleep also has implications for your health and overall quality of life. if you're regularly waking up at night, it's helpful to understand why, so that you can make changes to sleep better. to receive the benefits of a good night's sleep, the amount of time you sleep uninterrupted can be more important than the total amount of time you sleep overall. in other words, quality trumps quantity. that's because our sleep cycles are progressive. our brain cycles through the stages of sleep several times during the night, from light sleep to deep sleep to rapid eye movement (rem) sleep and back again.	our sleep cycles are progressive
why is it difficult to fall asleep when the body feels very hot?	one of the most important aspects of recovering from illness is getting restful sleep. unfortunately, congestion and a runny nose can make falling and staying asleep difficult. we will discuss whether it is possible to sleep off a cold, and share tips for sleeping better when you are sick. there is a reason why we tend to feel an increased urge to sleep when we fall sick. quality sleep helps the body prepare its defenses, whereas sleep deprivation negatively impacts the immune system. evidence suggests that going short on sleep leads to a higher chance of developing the common cold.	congestion and a runny nose
what is a sleep disorder	if your doctor suggests you undergo a sleep study, or polysomnography, you may be wondering what is involved in this test and what to expect. sleep studies help doctors diagnose sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, periodic limb movement disorder, narcolepsy, restless legs syndrome, insomnia, and nighttime behaviors like sleepwalking and rem sleep behavior disorder. often these disorders cannot be identified with a normal office visit-your doctor needs to gather more conclusive evidence while you're asleep. a sleep study is a non-invasive, overnight exam that allows doctors to monitor you while you sleep to see what's happening in your brain and body.	sleep apnea
what foods help with sleep?	diet and sleep are closely linked, and the circadian clock that guides your sleep-wake cycle also regulates your appetite. what you consume on a given day can play a pivotal role in how well you sleep that night. certain foods and beverages contain vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and other nutrients that promote feelings of relaxation and sleepiness before bedtime. if you struggle with falling or staying asleep, then incorporating these items into your diet may help mitigate your nightly issues. we discuss what to consume and what not to consume for better sleep. researchers have pinpointed several foods that contain vitamins, minerals, and macronutrients that are beneficial for sleep.	vitamins, minerals, and macronutrients
why do i gain weight after staying up late for long time?	i was never told that sleep was important, was never encouraged to do it, and i was never educated on it. in fact, if i had behaved properly and if i'd have done well at school, i could stay up late at night to watch the midweek sport, so i was getting rewarded for losing sleep. and by the time i got to my teenage years, i was allowed to play in a band midweek until midnight. my dad was a former semi-pro musician, so i was encouraged to follow that, and i'd be the kid at the back of the class falling asleep.	to watch the midweek sport
does having jet lag affect my sleep cycle?	all of these factors contribute to feeling exhausted after a long flight; however, this is distinct from jet lag. unlike jet lag, travel fatigue does not involve circadian rhythm disruption. for that reason, while travel fatigue usually goes away after a good night's sleep, jet lag can persist for days or weeks until a person's internal clock becomes realigned. it is possible to have both travel fatigue and jet lag after a long-haul flight, but jet lag is far more likely to cause lasting and extensive symptoms. jet lag can have ruinous effects on a vacation, business trip, or athletic competition.	jet lag is far more likely to cause lasting and extensive symptoms
how does sleeping help me?	when i'm not rested, i'm grumpy, crabby, and generally unpleasant. and, like her mom, my little girl is, too - but i had lost sight of that before a wearable helped me remember. although we received a lot of new information from the wearable, we did not change much in my daughter's schedule - no cancelled weekend movie nights in favor of sleep on the weekends, for sure. she needs to be a kid and have those cheating-the-system moments! what this experiment really helped me understand, however, is how significantly sleep impacts her every day. it also taught me how to approach her during an off-day.	how significantly sleep impacts her every day
how do i wake up properly without caffeine?	i was never told that sleep was important, was never encouraged to do it, and i was never educated on it. in fact, if i had behaved properly and if i'd have done well at school, i could stay up late at night to watch the midweek sport, so i was getting rewarded for losing sleep. and by the time i got to my teenage years, i was allowed to play in a band midweek until midnight. my dad was a former semi-pro musician, so i was encouraged to follow that, and i'd be the kid at the back of the class falling asleep.	i could stay up late at night to watch the midweek sport
how to determine poor sleep quality?	sleep quality is different from sleep quantity. sleep quantity measures how much sleep you get each night, while sleep quality measures how well you sleep. measuring sleep quantity is simple, as it's quick to determine if you're getting the recommended amount of sleep per night (usually defined as 7-9 hours for adults). measuring sleep quality is a little more of an art than a science. any number of things could be contributing to your poor sleep quality. some potential causes include poor sleep hygiene, stress, sleep apnea, or another chronic health condition or sleep disorder.	measuring sleep quantity is simple
how long before i sleep should i avoid my phone?	tracking my own sleep and movement is incredibly helpful in informing my day's activities. for example, i use data from my wearable to determine if i should push a little harder during my daily workout, or if i need to take it easier. plus, i truly appreciate the reminder to start winding down for sleep. i wondered if my daughter's experience would be the same. my daughter is like a typical nine-year-old, but with more energy. she's bright and bubbly some days, crabby and moody others, i asked if she thought it'd be fun if we strapped a wearable to her wrist 24/7.	daily workout
how long does it take for someone to develop and maintain a healthy sleep schedule?	if the sour taste of the cherry juice does not suit your preferences, you can also buy tart cherry extract as a supplement in pill form. the national institutes of health (nih) office of dietary supplements reports there are no safety concerns associated with drinking up to 16 ounces of tart cherry juice or taking 480 milligrams of tart cherry extract capsules once per day for up to two weeks. maintaining a healthy sleep routine promotes a good night's sleep. following the same schedule every night can help your body downshift from the day and prepare for sleep.	two weeks
i am addicted to eating sweets but i feel like it is affecting my sleep because i am always experiencing a sugar rush, are there alternatives to sweets?	she agreed and even seemed excited. i hoped this at-home experiment would provide insight into what her day was going to look like. could we predict her next day according to her daily sleep scores, sleep graphs, and daily energy output? in our home, we have strict nighttime routines, complete with timepoints for activities like brushing teeth, ensuring we abide by bedtime. because i am hyper-aware of sleep routines, proper sleep hygiene, and what stages of my sleep cycle i should be in throughout the night and when, i wondered if i could apply the data gathered by a wearable to my daughter.	apply the data gathered by a wearable to my daughter
how does alcohol affect my sleep?	heavy drinking means more than 15 drinks per week for men and more than eight drinks per week for women. will a small amount of alcohol affect my sleep? drinking to excess will probably have a more negative impact on sleep than light or moderate alcohol consumption. however, since the effects of alcohol are different from person to person, even small amounts of alcohol can reduce sleep quality for some people. one 2018 study compared sleep quality among subjects who consumed different amounts of alcohol. when should i stop drinking prior to bed to minimize sleep disruption? to reduce the risk of sleep disruptions, you should stop drinking alcohol at least four hours before bedtime.	drinking to excess will probably have a more negative impact on sleep
if my work requires me to be ready any time in the day, how can i still maintain healthy sleeping habits?	this wearables experience changed me, maybe more than it changed my daughter. i found myself altering how i approached her right from the beginning of the day depending on how well she slept. if she didn't sleep well or i noticed a lot of nighttime disturbances in her graph, i would allow her more leeway. giving her the benefit of doubt seemed to ease the bumps we'd hit throughout our daytime hours together, and even allow us to have a quiet and calm drift into the evening. this insight into my daughter's nine-year-old brain made me realize something so simple: we're not that much different.	i would allow her more leeway
what time should i sleep if i have an exam tomorrow for a university student?	i can't imagine why that's not common practice in all universities. it should be absolutely spoon fed to children and university graduates, because it's a no-brainer. it's now proven that children who get better sleep get better results in exams. i approach health from all different angles, so i get people coming to me either for a specific health need or a global intervention. and it's interesting when you look at the things that are components of health. you can't get away from exercise, sleep, and food. and they all crossover and interconnect. when you look at the rise in obesity and the decrease in sleep, they're pretty much interlinked, too.	children who get better sleep get better results in exams.
i find drinking enough water really hard, is there anyway i can motivate myself to drink more water?	not drinking enough water during the day can result in dehydration. dehydration causes muscle weakness and cramping. nocturnal leg cramps in particular are not associated with dehydration, but drinking water is still important. the exact amount of water you need to drink each day depends on your body weight, activity level, medications, and local climate. standing for extended periods: being on your feet for long periods of time can increase the risk of experiencing nocturnal leg cramps, making leg cramps a problem for people who must stand while they work. taking breaks from standing and setting aside time to elevate your feet may help.	not drinking enough water during the day
can i take afternoon naps?	it's a familiar feeling: the clock hits 3 p.m., and you're ready for your afternoon nap. you feel sluggish, tired, and unmotivated. research shows us that a quick mid-afternoon nap can increase productivity, learning, and memory. some companies have implemented areas for their employees to take a quick nap during the day to help boost productivity. however, not all jobs or schedules have this option. instead, consider adding one or more of the following foods to your afternoon routine to stay alert and productive and beat the afternoon slump. omega-3 fatty acids are healthy fats that support brain function.	not all jobs or schedules have this option
is there any diet that help me to have better sleep?	diet, exercise, and sleep are three pillars of a healthy life. while improving just one of these lifestyle factors can help people lead longer lives, several recent studies have suggested that improving all three may be a better way to improve both physical and mental health. diet, exercise, and sleep influence one another in complex and innumerable ways. learning about how these activities affect one another is an important part of understanding why research has shown that the more of these lifestyle behaviors you improve, the better your well-being. diet and nutrition affect virtually all aspects of our health.	improving all three may be a better way to improve both physical and mental health
why is it that sometimes, i don't feel well-rested despite getting 9 hours of sleep?	even now there's a piece of research done recently that indicated it's regarded as masculine to be underslept. this is despite all the scientific evidence proving that a good night's sleep is vital to our short- and long-term health. people who sleep too much are looked down on. people who get the right amount of sleep, well why do you need that much? when i left university, i went into advertising, and i was highly stressed. i used alcohol to get to sleep, and then once i decided i didn't want to drink anymore, i couldn't get to sleep.	once i decided i didn't want to drink anymore
does drinking water before sleep improve my sleep?	it is not uncommon to feel thirsty right before going to bed. in fact, a study in mice showed that the tendency to drink more in the evening might be a natural part of the sleep-wake cycle, in order to prevent becoming dehydrated overnight. although mild dehydration does not appear to directly impact sleep for otherwise healthy people, staying hydrated supports systems in the body that do impact your sleep. water is an essential nutrient for the human body, helping to remove waste, lubricate the joints, regulate body temperature, and cushion sensitive tissues. although recommendations vary, the general consensus is that adults should drink between 2.5 and 4.5 liters of water a day depending on their body weight and level of activity.	staying hydrated supports systems in the body that do impact your sleep
how can i stop myself from pressing snooze or missing my alarms in the morning?	this wearables experience changed me, maybe more than it changed my daughter. i found myself altering how i approached her right from the beginning of the day depending on how well she slept. if she didn't sleep well or i noticed a lot of nighttime disturbances in her graph, i would allow her more leeway. giving her the benefit of doubt seemed to ease the bumps we'd hit throughout our daytime hours together, and even allow us to have a quiet and calm drift into the evening. this insight into my daughter's nine-year-old brain made me realize something so simple: we're not that much different.	depending on how well she slept
how to fall asleep easier when i wake up during a night?	you might wonder, why do i keep waking up at 4 a.m.? waking up during the night is fairly common, with over 35% of people waking up during the night at least three times per week. environmental factors, such as a partner snoring, a change in the room temperature or a loud car driving by, may wake you up momentarily from sleep. usually, most people fall back asleep easily. if you are waking up at the same time each night or waking up frequently throughout the night and struggling with falling back asleep, it could be due to factors beyond your environment.	due to factors beyond your environment
why human should sleep?	some cultures also include spiders in their diet. we examine the physiology of human sleep and the behavior of spiders to illustrate why this statistic is unlikely to be true. so far, scientific studies have not confirmed that people eat any spiders at all during sleep. although it is not impossible for a spider to crawl into a person's mouth while they are sleeping, there are multiple reasons why this is highly unlikely. it is safe to say that humans would like to avoid eating spiders in their sleep, but spiders would also prefer not to be swallowed.	humans would like to avoid eating spiders in their sleep
what helps with sleep apnea?	continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) machines are often used to treat sleep apnea, a condition in which a person's breathing intermittently stops while sleeping. we'll explain what a cpap machine is and how it can be helpful for people experiencing sleep apnea. a cpap machine helps regulate breathing by supplying pressurized air through a hose and mask. the steady stream of oxygen helps prevent a person's airway from becoming collapsed or blocked, which is what causes interruptions in breathing. there are three common types of cpap masks, which are purchased separately from a cpap machine. choosing the right face mask style for your sleep position can positively influence the success of cpap therapy.	a cpap machine
what are the common sleep disorders	sleep disorders are intricately intertwined with mental and physical health issues, with one exacerbating the other in a cycle that can be hard to break. additionally, some sleep disorders are not evident to the sleeper, or they may mirror other conditions such as epilepsy, making them difficult to diagnose. some of the most common sleep disorders in children are night terrors and nightmares, sleep apnea, sleep talking and sleepwalking, snoring, and restless leg syndrome. nightmares can be frightening for toddlers, who have a harder time distinguishing what's real and what's not. children often wake up from nightmares, which usually occur during rem sleep.	some of the most common sleep disorders in children
how many hours of sleep does an adult require?	learning how much sleep is right for you can help you better understand whether you are oversleeping and take steps to improve your sleep hygiene. the american academy of sleep medicine offers guidelines regarding how many hours of sleep is needed for different age groups. adults generally require between seven and nine hours of sleep to feel well rested. infants, children, and adolescents require more sleep as they grow and develop. while the definition of oversleeping can vary from person to person, excessive sleep generally refers to adults who sleep nine hours or more each day and whose sleep habits interfere with their daily lives.	between seven and nine hours
can i drink decaffeinated coffee in the late afternoon or in the evening?	coffee and many types of tea contain caffeine. caffeine is generally safe in moderate quantities but can be harmful in excess or when consumed late in the day. drinking coffee in the afternoon or evening can also negatively impact sleep. caffeine sensitivity varies from person to person. in general, it's best to avoid caffeine for at least six hours before your planned bedtime to prevent sleep problems. earlier in the day, caffeine may provide a useful pick-me-up to counteract daytime sleepiness related to jet lag or travel fatigue; however, it's important not to rely on caffeine at the expense of sufficient nightly sleep.	afternoon or evening
what are the different stages of sleep	during a normal sleep period, you progress through four to five sleep cycles. each sleep cycle is made up of four individual sleep stages. the four stages of sleep are further broken down into two categories: rapid eye movement (rem) and non-rem sleep. these categories are important because what happens during rem sleep is dramatically different from what happens during non-rem stages. the first three stages of sleep are composed of non-rem activity. stage 1 is short, representing the act of dozing off and transitioning into sleep. in stage 2 the body and mind slow down as you settle into sleep.	rapid eye movement (rem) and non-rem sleep
what time should i wind down after studying for finals week?	when students miss out on sleep, they primarily miss out on rem sleep, which they need the most when they're studying for finals. question: during which stage of sleep do our brains process new information and memories? it's possible no one has more on their plate than a college student during finals week. but, do what you can to improve your sleep during this time. students who nap more tend to have higher gpas. napping right after you learn something can help improve your memory of the material. even a six-minute nap can improve your vocabulary memorization by 11%.	six-minute
are there any negative effects on health for sleeping too much?	as they age, it is normal for dogs to sleep more and wake up earlier to go to the bathroom. however, if you notice any significant or sudden changes, such as your dog sleeping much more or less than normal, talk to your veterinarian. sleep changes are sometimes a sign of an underlying health condition, such as arthritis, diabetes, a thyroid problem, or another disorder. just like humans, a dog's well-being can be negatively impacted by a lack of sleep. if your dog is getting too little sleep, you may notice them acting more stressed, anxious, or aggressive.	negatively impacted
why do i feel tired after sleeping 8 hours?	when a person experiences fatigue, they often feel tired but do not usually fall asleep when they want to be awake. excessive sleepiness is often referred to as excessive daytime sleepiness, or eds, by physicians and sleep specialists. to eliminate or reduce your eds, you must first figure out why you are experiencing it. if you experience excessive sleepiness, you've probably asked yourself, why am i so sleepy during the day? there is no single, universal answer to that question because different people experience excessive daytime sleepiness (eds) for various reasons. if you don't have health or psychiatric problems that could be causing your eds, consider exploring the possibility of a sleep disorder.	different people experience excessive daytime sleepiness
why do soft pillows help me to fall asleep, instead of hard pillows?	for example, bedding and soft objects in an infant's sleep area are associated with sudden infant death syndrome (sids), suffocation, and strangulation. also, babies should not fall asleep anywhere else where there are soft or loose objects like blankets and pillows, such as an adult's bed. the american academy of pediatrics (aap) recommends that babies do not sleep with loose blankets above or below them during their first year of life in order to prevent injury and death. additionally, babies should not sleep with any soft bedding, including pillows, loose sheets, comforters, quilts, stuffed animals, or crib bumpers. the american academy of pediatrics does not name a specific age when it becomes safe for a child to sleep with loose blankets.	to prevent injury and death
what is the leading cause of insomnia?	a reported 1 in 4 women have at least one symptom of insomnia, whether it's difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or both. in fact, women are 40% more likely to have insomnia at some point in life than men are, despite needing more sleep than men. different sleep strategies can be more or less helpful depending on what's causing your insomnia. we cover some of the common causes of insomnia in women and highlight effective sleep tips for women. women carry a greater risk for insomnia for a number of reasons. women are 1.7 times more likely to have anxiety or depression, both of which commonly coexist with insomnia.	anxiety or depression
will sleep improve my life?	using a wearable can help us pay attention and make small adjustments to daily practices, like sticking to a bedtime routine. these adjustments can enormously impact our moods, attitudes, and cognitive function. using a wearable has helped me gain insight into and improve my sleep routines. my experience prompted me to wonder, if sleep-tracking wearables help adults make positive lifestyle adjustments, would sleep tracking be beneficial for children, too? as the editor-in-chief of sleep foundation, i eat, breathe, and sleep sleep! for this reason, i felt excited to see how a sleep-tracking wearable might impact my nine-year-old daughter.	using a wearable has helped me gain insight into and improve my sleep routines
how long should my naps be to improve my levels of focus?	tracking my own sleep and movement is incredibly helpful in informing my day's activities. for example, i use data from my wearable to determine if i should push a little harder during my daily workout, or if i need to take it easier. plus, i truly appreciate the reminder to start winding down for sleep. i wondered if my daughter's experience would be the same. my daughter is like a typical nine-year-old, but with more energy. she's bright and bubbly some days, crabby and moody others, i asked if she thought it'd be fun if we strapped a wearable to her wrist 24/7.	a little harder
what type of exercises should i engage it to increase my restfulness?	she agreed and even seemed excited. i hoped this at-home experiment would provide insight into what her day was going to look like. could we predict her next day according to her daily sleep scores, sleep graphs, and daily energy output? in our home, we have strict nighttime routines, complete with timepoints for activities like brushing teeth, ensuring we abide by bedtime. because i am hyper-aware of sleep routines, proper sleep hygiene, and what stages of my sleep cycle i should be in throughout the night and when, i wondered if i could apply the data gathered by a wearable to my daughter.	strict nighttime routines
how to i reduce waking up at night?	different types of cbt have been developed for specific problems such as depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. in addition, cbt for insomnia (cbt-i) has a proven track record in reducing sleeping problems. a large clinical trial also showed that cbt-i could reduce symptoms of many mental health conditions, improving emotional well-being and decreasing psychotic episodes. whether and how types of cbt can be combined or sequenced to address both sleep and mental health problems is subject to ongoing research, but for many patients, help from a trained counselor to reframe their thinking can meaningfully improve both their sleep and mental state. a common cause of sleeping problems is poor sleep hygiene. stepping up sleep hygiene by cultivating habits and a bedroom setting that are conducive to sleep can go a long way in reducing sleep disruptions. finding the best routines and bedroom arrangement may take some trial and error to determine what's best for you, but that process can pay dividends in helping you fall asleep quickly and stay asleep through the night.	cbt for insomnia
what is the reasoning behind whether someone is a night owl or morning lark?	whether it is break-of-dawn school start times or early work meetings, most schedules seem to accommodate morning people. if you are wondering how to become a morning person, there are several factors to consider. being a night owl is hardwired to some extent, due to a phenomenon called chronotypes. that said, there are tactics you can use to make yourself feel more comfortable in the morning. we will explain the science behind chronotypes, and share tips for becoming more of a morning person. our sleep-wake cycles are dictated by our circadian rhythm, an internal body clock that regulates our energy levels throughout the day.	chronotypes
what is good sleep?	this hormone helps children grow and repairs cells and tissues in both children and adults. additionally, a good night's sleep helps the immune system defend against infections, which may explain why getting plenty of sleep keeps you healthy and also allows you to recover if you do become ill. the good news is that you can promote better sleep by creating a constructive bedtime routine and establishing excellent sleep hygiene. there's a lot of information about what to do before bedtime to get a good night's rest, but it's equally important to know what not to do.	helps the immune system defend against infections
is it normal to snore?	sleep-related hypoxemia disorder occurs mostly as the result of another health problem that affects breathing, including a number of types of lung conditions, and addressing hypoxemia frequently involves a focus on that underlying issue. snoring occurs when air moves around floppy tissue near the back of the throat and causes that tissue to vibrate. estimates hold that as many as 27% of children, 40% of adult women, and 57% of adult men snore. light snoring every once in a while is normal for most people and is not harmful. snoring that occurs more than three nights per week, though, is classified as a sleep-related breathing disorder.	light snoring every once in a while is normal
how do i sleep earlier	while our family chose the amazon halo for our experiment, there are numerous sleep trackers available that are appropriate for kids, such as the garmin vivofit jr. 2 and fitbit ace 2 and 3. the data these trackers provide can offer a new perspective on your child's daily and nightly routines and sleep quality. do i vote for every child being constantly analyzed for data? certainly not. you have to do what makes you and your family comfortable. wearables can be a gentle, fun, non-invasive way of gaining insight into your child's inner workings. and, hey, now my daughter wakes up every morning and asks, can i check my sleep score?. how much sleep do babies and kids need? do your children get enough sleep? is your child getting enough sleep? here's how to tell.	my daughter wakes up every morning

what are some sleep hygiene tips	by contrast, prescription sleep medications are regulated by the fda and require a prescription from a doctor or other medical professional. over-the-counter sleep aids may be more accessible and possibly more affordable. whether natural, prescription, or over-the-counter, all sleep aids come with potential side effects. finding what works for you might take some trial and error. talk to your doctor if you are having trouble sleeping. they may be able to recommend sleep hygiene tips, help you treat an underlying sleep disorder like insomnia, or recommend a safe treatment plan that includes natural, alternative, or pharmaceutical sleep aids.	help you treat an underlying sleep disorder like insomnia
is drug-induced sleep the same as normal sleep?	rem sleep constitutes the fourth and final stage of a normal sleep cycle; the first three stages consist of non-rapid eye movement (nrem) sleep. the general consensus among researchers today is that lucid dreams originate from non-lucid dreams during the rem sleep stage. in this sense, lucidity is an aspect of dreams that can be triggered using different means. spontaneous lucid dreams are rare and difficult to foresee. to study these phenomena, researchers typically induce lucid dreams using different methods. additionally, some studies have involved inducing lucid dreams using certain types of drugs and supplements.	rem sleep constitutes the fourth and final stage of a normal sleep cycle
how can i be flexible in adjusting my sleep and exercise schedule around social events?	using a wearable can help us pay attention and make small adjustments to daily practices, like sticking to a bedtime routine. these adjustments can enormously impact our moods, attitudes, and cognitive function. using a wearable has helped me gain insight into and improve my sleep routines. my experience prompted me to wonder, if sleep-tracking wearables help adults make positive lifestyle adjustments, would sleep tracking be beneficial for children, too? as the editor-in-chief of sleep foundation, i eat, breathe, and sleep sleep! for this reason, i felt excited to see how a sleep-tracking wearable might impact my nine-year-old daughter.	using a wearable
can i eat supper before going to bed?	if you frequently find yourself waking up to go to the washroom, you may also choose to drink less fluids overall before bed. a recent study found that eating within three hours of bedtime may lead to more nighttime awakenings. eating a heavy meal right before lying down can also cause heartburn, with accompanying discomfort that may make it even more difficult to sleep. if you suffer from heartburn, try to avoid fried, spicy, or acidic foods close to bedtime. for those who have trouble sleeping through the night on an empty stomach, the best option is to enjoy a small, nutritious bedtime snack.	eating a heavy meal right before lying down
what kind of stressors can cause our body to sleep	when we experience a stressful event, our bodies respond physiologically, in part, by releasing the stress hormone cortisol. we know this as the fight-or-flight response: we either want to fight off the danger or run from it. while our fight-or-flight response evolved to protect us from survival threats in earlier evolutionary times, our survival instinct remains today. today's stressors are everywhere. covid-19 is a threat to our survival. financial hardship threatens our food and shelter. even troubling news on tv can feel like a threat to our stability and survival. when these stressors trigger our stress response on a daily basis, in addition to other stressors that arise in our work or personal lives, our stress response works overtime.	stressors that arise in our work or personal lives
what affects my sleep?	she agreed and even seemed excited. i hoped this at-home experiment would provide insight into what her day was going to look like. could we predict her next day according to her daily sleep scores, sleep graphs, and daily energy output? in our home, we have strict nighttime routines, complete with timepoints for activities like brushing teeth, ensuring we abide by bedtime. because i am hyper-aware of sleep routines, proper sleep hygiene, and what stages of my sleep cycle i should be in throughout the night and when, i wondered if i could apply the data gathered by a wearable to my daughter.	hyper-aware of sleep routines
how can i sleep better?	what is a bad sleeper? and how much of that is something that's artificially constructed in our mind versus somebody who truly has a sleep problem? so yeah, i think that parents play a big role in these types of things. left to their own devices and with a little bit of help, parents can learn to really guide their kids into better sleep patterns and recognize problems when they exist. on what he tells new parents. number one, your child sleeps, it's impossible not to. now, what might be happening is that your child is not sleeping in a way that's predictable and efficient.	predictable and efficient
why am i easy to wake up?	using the amazon halo made it overwhelmingly obvious that bedtime was not something to be flimsy about. weekend movie nights, which lead to later bedtimes, cemented what i had suspected the entire time: less sleep makes for a discombobulated next day. as a grown-up, i sometimes find it hard to remember what it was like being a kid. adults can often have difficulty sympathizing with children because we perceive their problems as trivial compared with the problems we face. too frequently, i am guilty of forgetting that children's gripes are a big deal to them, even though they seem easy to solve for me.	children's gripes are a big deal to them
i often use eye drops to help sleep before going to bed. is this a healthy way?	if you prefer to go to sleep later, try not to get too much light in the morning hours. instead, go for an evening walk or use light therapy later in the day. this can help delay the release of melatonin and trick your body into delaying your bedtime. an easy way to improve sleep is by adopting sleep hygiene habits that strengthen the circadian rhythm and create a mental association between bed and sleep. you should also make it a priority to treat any underlying sleep disorders or other conditions such as chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart failure, or prostate disorders. talk to your doctor to see if you can adjust your medication schedule to minimize the effects on your sleep. in the short term, your doctor may prescribe melatonin supplements or cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (cbt-i) to help re-establish a healthy sleep pattern.	an easy way to improve sleep is by adopting sleep hygiene habits
how do i ensure that i get good quality of sleep if i am always randomly waking up during my sleep?	she agreed and even seemed excited. i hoped this at-home experiment would provide insight into what her day was going to look like. could we predict her next day according to her daily sleep scores, sleep graphs, and daily energy output? in our home, we have strict nighttime routines, complete with timepoints for activities like brushing teeth, ensuring we abide by bedtime. because i am hyper-aware of sleep routines, proper sleep hygiene, and what stages of my sleep cycle i should be in throughout the night and when, i wondered if i could apply the data gathered by a wearable to my daughter.	strict nighttime routines
i love working at night and i am happy to sleep at daytime. should i stick to my sleeping/waking schedule?	she agreed and even seemed excited. i hoped this at-home experiment would provide insight into what her day was going to look like. could we predict her next day according to her daily sleep scores, sleep graphs, and daily energy output? in our home, we have strict nighttime routines, complete with timepoints for activities like brushing teeth, ensuring we abide by bedtime. because i am hyper-aware of sleep routines, proper sleep hygiene, and what stages of my sleep cycle i should be in throughout the night and when, i wondered if i could apply the data gathered by a wearable to my daughter.	throughout the night and when
how long should a person sleep?	if you find yourself tossing and turning repeatedly after going to bed, you might wonder if you should be able to fall asleep within a specific amount of time. most healthy adults fall asleep within 10 to 20 minutes after turning off the lights and lying down for the night. falling asleep faster or slower than that range might indicate that something is affecting your sleep, such as an underlying sleep disorder, a health problem, or something you have consumed. people are not always able to accurately estimate how long it takes them to fall asleep. sleep specialists often measure how long it takes a person to fall asleep when they suspect an underlying problem, like insomnia or narcolepsy.	10 to 20 minutes
what is the relationship between good sleep and performance?	in response to these trends, many researchers began to hypothesize about potential connections between weight and sleep. numerous studies have suggested that restricted sleep and poor sleep quality may lead to metabolic disorders, weight gain, and an increased risk of obesity and other chronic health conditions. while there is continuing debate within the medical community about the exact nature of this relationship, the existing research points to a positive correlation between good sleep and healthy body weight. there remains much to be discovered about the intricate details of how sleep and weight are connected. several hypotheses offer paths for additional research with the hope that increasing our understanding of the relationship between weight and sleep will lead to reduced obesity and better weight-loss methods.	healthy body weight
how do you know if you are sleep deprived	knowing how to wash your sheets properly is just as important as knowing how often to clean them. since this process can take a few hours, investing in another set of sheets can make it easier to stick to a regular cleaning schedule. that way, all you need to do is change out the sheets and wash the dirty set when you do the rest of your laundry.	knowing how to wash your sheets properly
how does lack of sleep affect my mental health?	given the importance of sleep for brain function, it's easy to see why teens who don't get enough sleep tend to suffer from excessive drowsiness and lack of attention that can harm their academic performance. most people have experienced how sleep can affect mood, causing irritability and exaggerated emotional reactions. over time, the consequences can be even greater for teens who are adapting to more independence, responsibility, and new social relationships. prolonged sleep loss may negatively affect emotional development, increasing risks for interpersonal conflict as well as more serious mental health problems. mental health disorders like anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder have routinely been linked to poor sleep, and sleep deprivation in teens can increase the risk of suicide.	prolonged sleep loss may negatively affect emotional development
can i do extensive workout before i sleep?	tracking my own sleep and movement is incredibly helpful in informing my day's activities. for example, i use data from my wearable to determine if i should push a little harder during my daily workout, or if i need to take it easier. plus, i truly appreciate the reminder to start winding down for sleep. i wondered if my daughter's experience would be the same. my daughter is like a typical nine-year-old, but with more energy. she's bright and bubbly some days, crabby and moody others, i asked if she thought it'd be fun if we strapped a wearable to her wrist 24/7.	push a little harder
it is hard to reduce digital screentime, what are the alternatives?	cbt-i is often provided by a doctor, counselor, therapist, or psychiatrist trained in this form of treatment. practitioners with experience in cbt-i can be found through professional organizations such as the society of behavioral sleep medicine and the american board of sleep medicine. unfortunately, due to the widespread need for this treatment, there aren't enough cbt-i professionals to meet the current demand. in response, researchers have developed new ways of offering cbt-i, such as digital, group, and self-help formats. several digital cbt-i (sometimes called dcbt-i or dcbt) applications have been developed in order to adapt to this trend, reduce the cost of treatment, and offer the benefits of cbt-i to a wider audience.	digital, group, and self-help
how long should my naps be?	people nap for a variety of reasons. perhaps taking an afternoon siesta is part of your culture, or maybe you have noticed a midday nap helps you feel less stressed. however, busy work schedules do not always allow for long daytime breaks to retreat to bed. this is why many people are intrigued by the idea of the power nap. we explore this short nap, specifically designed for workers, and delve into how long a power nap should be, the benefits it provides, how it compares to drinking coffee for alertness, and tips for a better power nap.	short nap, specifically designed for workers, and delve into how long
what are the biological processes of sleep?	for this reason, circadian rhythms are closely connected to day and night. while other cues, like exercise, social activity, and temperature, can affect the master clock, light is the most powerful influence on circadian rhythms. biological clocks help regulate the timing of bodily processes, including circadian rhythms. a circadian rhythm is an effect of a biological clock, but not all biological clocks are circadian. for instance, plants adjust to changing seasons using a biological clock with timing that is distinct from a 24-hour cycle. when people talk about circadian rhythm, it's most often in the context of sleep.	biological clocks help regulate the timing of bodily processes, including circadian rhythms
does sleep help with overcoming stress	studies have shown cbsm can be an effective measure for various groups that tend to experience undue stress, such as professional nurses, people with substance abuse disorders, and individuals living with hiv. incidentally, cognitive behavioral therapy has also proven effective for alleviating insomnia symptoms. known as cbt-i for short, this type of therapy helps people overcome misconceptions or negative beliefs about sleep in order to get more rest and overcome their insomnia. cbt-i emphasizes sleep restriction and the importance of getting out of bed on sleepless nights, as well as proper sleep hygiene and relaxation techniques. you should see your doctor or another physician immediately if you're experiencing suicidal thoughts, abusing drugs or alcohol, or feeling that you can't cope with day-to-day life due to stressors. you can also call the national suicide prevention lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (1-800-273-talk). the lifeline also offers 24-hour live online chat on their website, as well.	helps people overcome misconceptions or negative beliefs about sleep
is it okay for me to exercise right before bed?	chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs), also called myalgic encephalomyelitis (me) and systemic exertion intolerance disease (seid), causes people to experience severe fatigue and unrefreshing sleep. worldwide, about 1% of people likely have chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (cfs/me), with the disorder occurring more frequently in women. an estimated 2 million americans have cfs/me. cfs/me fatigue commonly debilitates people who have the illness, leading to unemployment or requiring a person to spend much of their time in bed. in addition, some people with cfs/me also experience symptoms other than fatigue, such as pain, sleep troubles, cognitive problems, and exercise intolerance.	exercise intolerance
is snoring a bad sign for average-sized people?	these changes led to significantly less snoring and fewer instances of lapsed breathing. researchers have not yet examined if or how mouth taping impacts snoring in people who do not have obstructive sleep apnea. as a result, more research is needed to say with certainty whether mouth taping can effectively treat snoring due to other causes. anecdotally, people claim mouth taping eases a variety of problems, such as snoring, fatigue, concentration issues, bad breath, and excessive thirst at night. most of these claims have not been scientifically studied. so far, research has only demonstrated one benefit of mouth taping: a reduction in snoring and tiredness in people with obstructive sleep apnea.	significantly less snoring
how can i make my sleep environment more conducive?	using a wearable can help us pay attention and make small adjustments to daily practices, like sticking to a bedtime routine. these adjustments can enormously impact our moods, attitudes, and cognitive function. using a wearable has helped me gain insight into and improve my sleep routines. my experience prompted me to wonder, if sleep-tracking wearables help adults make positive lifestyle adjustments, would sleep tracking be beneficial for children, too? as the editor-in-chief of sleep foundation, i eat, breathe, and sleep sleep! for this reason, i felt excited to see how a sleep-tracking wearable might impact my nine-year-old daughter.	using a wearable
how much sleep is enough if i haven't been sleeping well lately?	this wearables experience changed me, maybe more than it changed my daughter. i found myself altering how i approached her right from the beginning of the day depending on how well she slept. if she didn't sleep well or i noticed a lot of nighttime disturbances in her graph, i would allow her more leeway. giving her the benefit of doubt seemed to ease the bumps we'd hit throughout our daytime hours together, and even allow us to have a quiet and calm drift into the evening. this insight into my daughter's nine-year-old brain made me realize something so simple: we're not that much different.	i would allow her more leeway
why do i frequently experience heartburn or acid reflux at night (close to my bedtime)?	frequent urination at night, known as nocturia, can hinder sleep and affects more than 75% of women over age 40, often because of a connection to higher rates of incontinence and overactive bladder in women. women are more likely to experience heartburn and acid reflux, which can worsen overall sleep. gender-based influences on sleep are closely intertwined with social and cultural norms that have unequal impacts on women and men. because these norms are complex, they may implicate sleep in multifaceted ways that are not the same for all individuals. caregiving is a prime example of a gender-based factor that affects sleep.	can worsen overall sleep
what temperature should the room i am sleeping in be?	she agreed and even seemed excited. i hoped this at-home experiment would provide insight into what her day was going to look like. could we predict her next day according to her daily sleep scores, sleep graphs, and daily energy output? in our home, we have strict nighttime routines, complete with timepoints for activities like brushing teeth, ensuring we abide by bedtime. because i am hyper-aware of sleep routines, proper sleep hygiene, and what stages of my sleep cycle i should be in throughout the night and when, i wondered if i could apply the data gathered by a wearable to my daughter.	throughout the night and when
there are times when i remember my dreams, hence i would like to ask how are memories formed when we dream?	you know why would that be? one theory could be, maybe that child is excessively sleepy, and you've made him less so with that medication. i think back to when my first child was born. we came home, we put her in that little chair that kind of bounces. it's got a little angle, and i remember sitting there and we looked at each other like, well, god now what? we're pretty smart people. but i think when it comes to sleep and our kids, we don't really get a lot of instruction. it's something we talk a lot about, but not in ways that might be particularly helpful for parents.	we don't really get a lot of instruction
is it healthy to have supper often with my friends?	it's out in the open your hamstring hurts, let's talk about it so we can figure out we need to do something. but we don't sometimes talk about sleep in meaningful ways. so my hope is this book creates a conversation about it, because i don't think we can talk about it too much. and so when you're out with your friends, and you're talking about, my kid does this in his sleep and i read something about that one time, my hope is that this gets people talking, and moving in directions of finding that solution.	my kid does this in his sleep
i have been having bad sleeping habits but i am still well and alive so why should i try to alter my sleeping habits	this wearables experience changed me, maybe more than it changed my daughter. i found myself altering how i approached her right from the beginning of the day depending on how well she slept. if she didn't sleep well or i noticed a lot of nighttime disturbances in her graph, i would allow her more leeway. giving her the benefit of doubt seemed to ease the bumps we'd hit throughout our daytime hours together, and even allow us to have a quiet and calm drift into the evening. this insight into my daughter's nine-year-old brain made me realize something so simple: we're not that much different.	i would allow her more leeway
should i eat if i feel hungry right before i sleep?	even now there's a piece of research done recently that indicated it's regarded as masculine to be underslept. this is despite all the scientific evidence proving that a good night's sleep is vital to our short- and long-term health. people who sleep too much are looked down on. people who get the right amount of sleep, well why do you need that much? when i left university, i went into advertising, and i was highly stressed. i used alcohol to get to sleep, and then once i decided i didn't want to drink anymore, i couldn't get to sleep.	i couldn't get to sleep
does alcohol help me sleep better?	when you feel tired, a good night's sleep can usually help you feel refreshed. in contrast, fatigue is a prolonged feeling of tiredness and lack of energy that typically isn't resolved by sleeping. as much as 50% of the people report symptoms of fatigue at some point. fatigue is common after sleep deprivation, long periods of stress, and physical activity. however, fatigue can also be a symptom of an underlying health concern. me/cfs is a common cause of chronic fatigue. people with chronic fatigue syndrome experience persistent fatigue lasting longer than six months that does not get better with rest.	a good night's sleep can usually help you feel refreshed
i know that sleep is important but i can't seem to get to bed before 4 am. how can i change my sleeping habits?	she agreed and even seemed excited. i hoped this at-home experiment would provide insight into what her day was going to look like. could we predict her next day according to her daily sleep scores, sleep graphs, and daily energy output? in our home, we have strict nighttime routines, complete with timepoints for activities like brushing teeth, ensuring we abide by bedtime. because i am hyper-aware of sleep routines, proper sleep hygiene, and what stages of my sleep cycle i should be in throughout the night and when, i wondered if i could apply the data gathered by a wearable to my daughter.	apply the data gathered by a wearable to my daughter.
what is the fastest way to go to sleep?	student athletes who regularly sleep less than eight hours a night are 1.7 times more likely to sustain an injury. studies on short-term and long-term sleep deprivation propose that sleep deprivation lowers endurance in runners, cyclists, and weight lifters. sleep-deprived athletes subjectively tire faster and find it more of an effort to complete tasks. short-term sleep debt can also influence performance. one study on athletes found that their reaction times were fastest on mondays and tuesdays, after having had the weekend to catch up on sleep. sleep deprivation also has consequences outside of the athletic world.	weekend
how does sleep affect memory	people who don't get enough sleep may experience the effects of sleep deprivation. difficulty remembering things is one common symptom. since the brain does not have sufficient time to create new pathways for the information you've recently learned, sleep deprivation often affects how memories are consolidated. other potential cognitive impacts include trouble learning and focusing, reduced decision-making skills, and poor emotional and behavioral control. how much sleep you should get each night largely depends on your age. in addition to adults, studies have concluded children experience stronger memory consolidation after a good night's sleep. that said, excessive sleep can also lead to cognitive impairments.	sleep deprivation often affects how memories are consolidated
how can i go to bed earlier?	then, they won't have to quickly adjust back to their school sleep schedules after the break. whenever possible, try to help your children keep a consistent routine of going to bed and waking up at the same time each day. that way, even when school restarts after a break, they are already in the habit of having scheduled sleep. so how can parents help their children get back on a sleep schedule for going back to school? take it one day at a time! the process of adjusting a sleep schedule should be incremental. in the weeks leading up to going back to school, have your child wake up 15 minutes earlier and go to sleep 15 minutes earlier than they have been during their break.	have your child wake up 15 minutes earlier
how common are sleep disorders	sleep issues are common during pregnancy. studies suggest that up to 92% of pregnant people experience poor sleep quality at some point during their pregnancy. more than half report insomnia symptoms during pregnancy, and a significant percentage experience symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing and restless legs syndrome. additionally, pregnant people are susceptible to nausea, heartburn, leg cramps, and other types of discomfort while they sleep. there are measures people can take to sleep better and feel less tired during pregnancy. understanding how pregnancy affects sleep during each trimester and how to work around these issues is key to getting enough rest while pregnant, though postpartum sleep issues are also somewhat common.	sleep issues are common during pregnancy
do you some methods to improve your sleeping quality?	a noisy environment can disrupt sleep and increase the risk of long-term health effects. the world health organization recommends keeping environmental noise levels below 40 decibels at night. unfortunately, depending on where you live, it may be impossible to ensure a sufficiently quiet bedroom environment. there is growing interest in using sounds such as music and white noise to reduce the effects of environmental noise. using sound to improve sleep is an easy, low-cost method with few known side effects. research so far demonstrates that certain sounds may help people relax for sleep and improve sleep quality, so it's worth examining how to do so, as well as what sounds work best for sleep.	using sound
how does sleeping affect our daily performance?	this ensures that all of our performance tests and ratings address the needs of sleepers of varying sizes. to give you a better idea of how body weight affects mattress performance and comfort, we'll discuss this factor in detail and explain how it fits into our mattress testing protocols. when shopping for a new mattress, it's important to consider how much you weigh. the same mattress generally feels softer to a heavier person than it does to a lighter individual due to the amount of force on the surface. we've found that sleepers with similar body weights tend to have similar comfort preferences.	performance tests and ratings address the needs of sleepers of varying sizes
i am allergic to milk, are there any alternatives drinks?	pregnant people are also at risk for sleep disorders like insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea. taking any prescription or over-the-counter medication or supplement while pregnant can pose fetal health risks. this also applies to pain medications like ibuprofen during the latter stages of pregnancy. do not take any medication for sleeping or pain relief at any stage of pregnancy without consulting your doctor. certain foods and drinks can induce sleepiness without posing risks to an unborn baby. these alternatives to sleep medication include warm milk, tart cherry juice, kiwis, and fatty fish.	warm milk, tart cherry juice, kiwis, and fatty fish
sleep and aromatherapy: do having fragrances throughout sleep help?	the focus of this learning technique is to use odors as a memory cue. to accomplish this, a person is exposed to a specific fragrance while awake and learning new information. then, they are exposed to that same fragrance during sleep. in a study of school children, memory recall on a vocabulary test was improved by this odor-based cueing. additional benefits may come from being exposed to that same smell during testing the next day as well. while this method does not eliminate the hard work of having to learn new material, it may benefit students and others who want to boost their chances of building useful memory during sleep. while many people are intrigued by aromatherapy to help them sleep, others want to know how to harness smells to feel more alert in the morning. getting good sleep is your best bet for waking up refreshed and ready to go, and aromatherapy won't make up for insufficient sleep. that said, some smells may increase your attention and energy in the morning or through the day.	many people are intrigued by aromatherapy to help them sleep
what is the recommended sleep duration	what we eat also impacts sleep quality and duration. caffeine is notorious for making it more difficult to fall asleep and eating too close to bedtime can lead to sleep disruptions. most health experts recommend avoiding caffeine prior to sleeping. having too much calories or fat in your diet may make it harder to get enough sleep, as do diets lacking key nutrients, like calcium, magnesium, and vitamins a, c, d, and e. exercise is a cornerstone of health and benefits nearly every system in the body. many of the benefits are seen immediately, like reduced anxiety, lowered blood pressure, and better sleep.	most health experts recommend avoiding caffeine prior to sleeping
why can i never sleep through the night without waking up multiple times during a night?	you might wonder, why do i keep waking up at 4 a.m.? waking up during the night is fairly common, with over 35% of people waking up during the night at least three times per week. environmental factors, such as a partner snoring, a change in the room temperature or a loud car driving by, may wake you up momentarily from sleep. usually, most people fall back asleep easily. if you are waking up at the same time each night or waking up frequently throughout the night and struggling with falling back asleep, it could be due to factors beyond your environment.	factors beyond your environment
my brother moves a lot in his sleep, sometimes falling off the bed or waking up. should i be concerned, and if so is there anything i can do to help him sleep better?	it's out in the open your hamstring hurts, let's talk about it so we can figure out we need to do something. but we don't sometimes talk about sleep in meaningful ways. so my hope is this book creates a conversation about it, because i don't think we can talk about it too much. and so when you're out with your friends, and you're talking about, my kid does this in his sleep and i read something about that one time, my hope is that this gets people talking, and moving in directions of finding that solution.	when you're out with your friends
how does my sleeping attire impact my sleep quality?	using a wearable can help us pay attention and make small adjustments to daily practices, like sticking to a bedtime routine. these adjustments can enormously impact our moods, attitudes, and cognitive function. using a wearable has helped me gain insight into and improve my sleep routines. my experience prompted me to wonder, if sleep-tracking wearables help adults make positive lifestyle adjustments, would sleep tracking be beneficial for children, too? as the editor-in-chief of sleep foundation, i eat, breathe, and sleep sleep! for this reason, i felt excited to see how a sleep-tracking wearable might impact my nine-year-old daughter.	improve my sleep routines
what should i do before sleeping to get better sleep?	i can't imagine why that's not common practice in all universities. it should be absolutely spoon fed to children and university graduates, because it's a no-brainer. it's now proven that children who get better sleep get better results in exams. i approach health from all different angles, so i get people coming to me either for a specific health need or a global intervention. and it's interesting when you look at the things that are components of health. you can't get away from exercise, sleep, and food. and they all crossover and interconnect. when you look at the rise in obesity and the decrease in sleep, they're pretty much interlinked, too.	exams
can you recover from chronic sleep deprivation?	sleeping less than seven hours per night on a regular basis increases the risk of diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and stroke. sleep deprivation is also linked to reduced immune function, metabolic dysregulation and weight gain, and a greater risk of falls and accidents. prolonged sleep deprivation also affects memory and cognitive functions. since being chronically underslept can have such serious consequences, it's natural to want to know how to recover from lost sleep. the good news is, by taking the right steps, people can recover and regain the benefits of sufficient, quality rest. sleep debt, also called a sleep deficit, is the difference between the amount of sleep someone needs and the amount they actually get.	people can recover and regain the benefits of sufficient, quality rest
how does alcohol affect sleep	does alcohol help you sleep? alcohol may aid with sleep onset due to its sedative properties, allowing you to fall asleep more quickly. however, people who drink before bed often experience disruptions later in their sleep cycle as liver enzymes metabolize alcohol. this can also lead to excessive daytime sleepiness and other issues the following day. furthermore, drinking to fall asleep can build a tolerance, forcing you to consume more alcohol each successive night in order to experience the sedative effects. does alcohol affect men and women differently? on average, women exhibit signs of intoxication earlier and with lower doses of alcohol than men.	allowing you to fall asleep more quickly
what time should i eat dinner before sleeping to avoid indigestion during sleep?	if timed correctly, you'll start to feel the effects of caffeine right after you wake up. following a balanced, healthy diet can be challenging if you work evening or night shifts. additionally, people with night or rotating work schedules are more susceptible to gastrointestinal problems than those who work during the day. these issues may include indigestion, heartburn, stomach aches, and loss of appetite. if you need a snack during work, nuts and fruit are more nourishing than junk food such as candy or soft drinks. you should also avoid greasy food. in addition to eating the right things, you should also strive to eat each meal at the same times, including days you don't work.	days you don't work
what time should i stop studying to have a good quality of sleep?	heavy drinking means more than 15 drinks per week for men and more than eight drinks per week for women. will a small amount of alcohol affect my sleep? drinking to excess will probably have a more negative impact on sleep than light or moderate alcohol consumption. however, since the effects of alcohol are different from person to person, even small amounts of alcohol can reduce sleep quality for some people. one 2018 study compared sleep quality among subjects who consumed different amounts of alcohol. when should i stop drinking prior to bed to minimize sleep disruption? to reduce the risk of sleep disruptions, you should stop drinking alcohol at least four hours before bedtime.	four hours before bedtime
how long should i exercise before sleep?	for some people, exercising too late in the day can keep them up at night. in addition to elevating your mood, the endorphin release associated with exercise can energize your brain, leading some people to feel more alert. for this reason, experts recommend avoiding exercise at least 2 hours before bed so those effects can wear off. however, the drop in body temperature that occurs after exercising can begin 30 to 90 minutes later, which may help with falling asleep. to figure out the right time for you to exercise, consider keeping a sleep diary. record when you exercise, what type of exercise you did and for how long, when you went to bed, and how long it took you to fall asleep.	2 hours
is putting my phone on my bed normal when going to sleep?	together, we decided on the amazon halo. the halo is a relatively inexpensive fitness wearable that does not have a screen (score!) but tracks sleep. the halo comes in three default band colors: black, silver, and light pink. there are also a variety of both fabric and silicone replacement bands available in many different colors. we settled on the color unicorn, a soft fabric band with light aqua and pink. next, we downloaded the amazon halo app to my phone, and we were off! my expectation was that if my daughter's sleep scores were in the 90s - demonstrating that she cycled through four stages of sleep with optimal time spent in each - her mood, energy, and outlook for the day would be positive.	we were off!
how much caffeine is too much?	severe symptoms of caffeine overdose can happen at 1.2 grams, or just three times the maximum recommended daily dose. if you feel like you have had a little too much caffeine for the day, stop drinking or eating any more caffeinated foods or beverages and start drinking water to stay hydrated. monitor your symptoms and contact poison control if you develop any symptoms of caffeine intoxication. the strong effects of caffeine generally take four to six hours to wear off, and they may take longer when combined with alcohol or certain medications. if you feel like you are consuming too much caffeine in general, consider opting for decaffeinated drinks or limiting caffeine to the morning so it has less effect on your sleep.	a little
what happens if i sleep for too long?	even now there's a piece of research done recently that indicated it's regarded as masculine to be underslept. this is despite all the scientific evidence proving that a good night's sleep is vital to our short- and long-term health. people who sleep too much are looked down on. people who get the right amount of sleep, well why do you need that much? when i left university, i went into advertising, and i was highly stressed. i used alcohol to get to sleep, and then once i decided i didn't want to drink anymore, i couldn't get to sleep.	people who sleep too much are looked down on
what time should i exercise if i want to increase my sleep quality?	she agreed and even seemed excited. i hoped this at-home experiment would provide insight into what her day was going to look like. could we predict her next day according to her daily sleep scores, sleep graphs, and daily energy output? in our home, we have strict nighttime routines, complete with timepoints for activities like brushing teeth, ensuring we abide by bedtime. because i am hyper-aware of sleep routines, proper sleep hygiene, and what stages of my sleep cycle i should be in throughout the night and when, i wondered if i could apply the data gathered by a wearable to my daughter.	throughout the night and when
sometimes i sleep for more than ten hours but still feel tired, what can be the reason?	adults need seven to nine hours of sleep per night to feel rested. teenagers require a bit more, between eight to ten hours. our circadian rhythms, or internal body clock, regulate our natural sleep schedule. during adolescence, we experience a circadian shift, where our bodies naturally tire later. unfortunately, this circadian shift during adolescence occurs at a time when school starts even earlier. starting in high school and continuing into college, students struggle with waking up way earlier than their bodies want them to. even if students do manage to get a full night's sleep, this shift in sleep schedule can still lead to negative effects, like poor mood and concentration, and increased feelings of depression.	poor mood and concentration, and increased feelings of depression
sleeping too less is definitely not healthy, but how about exeeding the suggested eight hour sleep each day?	although sleep needs vary among children, the national sleep foundation provides guidelines for how many hours babies and toddlers should sleep during each 24-hour period. if you are concerned that your baby sleeps too much or too little, contact your pediatrician. expert guidelines outline how much babies should sleep during both day and night. for this reason, how much a baby should nap largely depends on how much they sleep at night. babies should nap as many hours as needed to get sufficient sleep in a 24-hour period. for example, guidelines recommend that 6-month-olds should sleep 12 to 16 hours a day, so if they sleep eight hours at night, they should nap around four to eight hours during the day.	contact your pediatrician
if i sleep during the day and work at night but still get enough sleep, is this considered as a healthy sleep schedule?	this includes shifts at night or in the early morning, rotating shifts, and split shifts. irregular shift work schedules can give rise to a unique set of sleep problems known as shift work sleep disorder, which is characterized by insomnia, excessive daytime tiredness, and loss of sleep. people with shift work disorder are considered at higher risk for workplace accidents, vehicle collisions caused by drowsy driving, and depression. establishing a sleep schedule is especially challenging for shift workers. following sleep hygiene guidelines is a good starting point. whether you work during the day or at night, the key to perfecting a sleep schedule is consistency. there is no universal sleep schedule that works for everyone, so make adjustments to your routine as needed to ensure you get enough sleep on a daily basis.	consistency
what is a good and relaxing environment for sleep?	also, be sure your sleep environment is cool, dark, and noise-free. you may also want to try relaxing activities in the evening to prepare you for sleep, such as reading or gentle yoga. keep electronics away to avoid blue light disrupting your circadian rhythm. just like a skincare routine, finding a good sleep routine takes some practice. with a little patience, you'll discover what works well for you and that beauty sleep will come easier.	reading or gentle yoga
why sleep is essential for overall health?	tryptophan is an essential amino acid that plays an important role in a handful of different bodily processes. many people associate tryptophan with turkey and feelings of sleepiness after holiday meals, but it is found in a wide variety of foods and beverages. some people also take tryptophan supplements, though their safety and efficacy is not well-researched. there are common misconceptions about what tryptophan is, how it works, and whether or not it makes you sleepy. we delve into the science behind tryptophan and discuss why it is important to your overall health. tryptophan is integral to infant growth and development, as well as the production and upkeep of various enzymes, muscles, neurotransmitters, and proteins in the body.	tryptophan
why do people sleep walk or talk during their sleep?	by adulthood, sleep talking is less common, affecting only 6% of adults on a weekly basis. researchers still do not know with certainty what causes sleep talking. in most cases, sleep talking is harmless and does not require treatment. sleep talking can occur with other parasomnias, or abnormal behaviors that occur during sleep, such as sleepwalking, nightmares, and teeth grinding. researchers have found that these parasomnias share some genetic associations, which may explain why sleep talking can run in families. sleep talking is twice as common among people with psychiatric disorders, especially post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd).	sleep talking is harmless and does not require treatment
how do i go back to sleep if i wake up in the middle of the night	i definitely do not advise parents letting them cry themselves to sleep. i encourage babies to be comforted and soothed. i would start by having parents teach a baby how to self-soothe. so for example, never put a baby down asleep. the aim here is to put your baby down to sleep, aware of their surroundings and drowsy. the goal is to put babies down almost asleep, so that they learn the ability to fall asleep on their own. babies get mini sleeps - when they wake up, they need to have the opportunity to get back to sleep on their own.	they need to have the opportunity to get back to sleep on their own
sometimes i sleep at 4 am for a few days, and then i crash until 5pm on the weekends. i don't feel anything after that, so should i change my sleeping habits?	she agreed and even seemed excited. i hoped this at-home experiment would provide insight into what her day was going to look like. could we predict her next day according to her daily sleep scores, sleep graphs, and daily energy output? in our home, we have strict nighttime routines, complete with timepoints for activities like brushing teeth, ensuring we abide by bedtime. because i am hyper-aware of sleep routines, proper sleep hygiene, and what stages of my sleep cycle i should be in throughout the night and when, i wondered if i could apply the data gathered by a wearable to my daughter.	throughout the night
how do i measure the quality of my sleep?	while our family chose the amazon halo for our experiment, there are numerous sleep trackers available that are appropriate for kids, such as the garmin vivofit jr. 2 and fitbit ace 2 and 3. the data these trackers provide can offer a new perspective on your child's daily and nightly routines and sleep quality. do i vote for every child being constantly analyzed for data? certainly not. you have to do what makes you and your family comfortable. wearables can be a gentle, fun, non-invasive way of gaining insight into your child's inner workings. and, hey, now my daughter wakes up every morning and asks, can i check my sleep score?. how much sleep do babies and kids need? do your children get enough sleep? is your child getting enough sleep? here's how to tell.	can i check my sleep score
will sleeping on a memory foam pillow help me sleep better or will a normal one do just fine?	your doctor will need to ask questions and order tests to determine what is causing fatigue in your personal situation. preparing for your appointment can help it go more smoothly. tracking the frequency, timing, and severity of your symptoms might help your doctor better understand what you're experiencing. tracking your activity level and symptoms can also help you draw connections and learn your limits so that you can reduce flare-ups. when tracking your symptoms, remember to write down everything ailing you, not just fatigue. people with cfs/me often also have issues with pain, cognition, such as memory and concentration, and sleep.	sleep.
how is sleep beneficial for my immune system?	while this immune system activity during sleep is beneficial, a critical aspect of this process is that it is self-regulating. as the sleep period winds down, the body's circadian rhythm ramps down this inflammation. in this way, getting enough high-quality sleep facilitates the delicate balance of immune function that is vital for both innate and adaptive immunity. studies have clearly shown that sleep improves the effects of vaccines, demonstrating sleep's benefits for adaptive immunity. vaccines work by introducing a weakened or deactivated antigen to the body, triggering an immune response. in this way, immunizations effectively teach the immune system to recognize and attack that antigen.	self-regulating
is it good to have lunch nap?	one key to a successful nap is taking it at the right time. too early or late of a nap can make you feel groggy. a poorly timed nap can also negatively impact the shuteye you get at night. however, following the natural sleepiness rhythms of your body can help you time your nap just right. the best time to take a nap for most people is either right before lunch, around 12:30 p.m., or during the post-lunch dip, around 2 p.m. during the post-lunch dip, also called the nap zone, you are more likely to feel a little sleepy or fatigued.	the best time to take a nap for most people is either right before lunch
can i sleep in contact lenses?	one-third of people who wear contact lenses admit having slept or napped without taking them out first. we discuss what happens if you sleep with contacts in, why this may leave you more vulnerable to infection, and how to protect your eyes if you wear contact lenses. experts strongly recommend against sleeping with contact lenses in. people who sleep in contact lenses are six to eight times more likely to develop an eye infection. all types of contact lenses increase your risk of infection, even extended wear lenses and lenses that are approved for use overnight by the federal drug administration (fda).	experts strongly recommend against sleeping with contact lenses in
when should one have dinner?	having a steady sleep schedule, making the bedroom dark, quiet, and comfortable, and limiting caffeine intake late in the day are examples of steps to enhance sleep hygiene. while sleepiness after a meal is often associated with lunch, it can occur with dinner, too, especially when dinner is eaten late in the evening. some people may be inclined to have a late dinner, but research suggests that eating soon before bed can disrupt healthy sleep patterns. a late dinner has also been associated with a higher risk of health problems like obesity and metabolic syndrome. post-meal sleepiness may be related to general daytime fatigue.	late in the evening
does sleep-talking mean that i don't get good quality sleep?	it's out in the open your hamstring hurts, let's talk about it so we can figure out we need to do something. but we don't sometimes talk about sleep in meaningful ways. so my hope is this book creates a conversation about it, because i don't think we can talk about it too much. and so when you're out with your friends, and you're talking about, my kid does this in his sleep and i read something about that one time, my hope is that this gets people talking, and moving in directions of finding that solution.	we don't sometimes talk about sleep in meaningful ways.
what do i do if i can't fall asleep	i was never told that sleep was important, was never encouraged to do it, and i was never educated on it. in fact, if i had behaved properly and if i'd have done well at school, i could stay up late at night to watch the midweek sport, so i was getting rewarded for losing sleep. and by the time i got to my teenage years, i was allowed to play in a band midweek until midnight. my dad was a former semi-pro musician, so i was encouraged to follow that, and i'd be the kid at the back of the class falling asleep.	i'd be the kid at the back of the class falling asleep
what is the difference between central and obstructive sleep apnea?	the main difference between asv and cpap machines is that asv machines deliver air pressure dynamically, adjusting according to the person's breathing patterns, whereas cpap machines deliver a set level of air pressure throughout the night. each device has specific benefits depending on the type of sleep apnea. both central and obstructive sleep apnea cause temporary pauses in breathing, called apneic events. obstructive sleep apnea causes apneic events when the airways become blocked or narrowed. in central sleep apnea, apneic events occur when the brain fails to signal the respiratory muscles to breathe, as opposed to a physical relaxation or obstruction of the muscles.	cause temporary pauses in breathing
can i go for a jog 2 hours before sleep time?	and that's where, as a parent, you can really struggle. i think that with parents, understand that your kid's going to do what he needs to do and you're not going to really screw that up. we don't have as much control over the situation as one might think. a lot of times in sleep, we talk in averages. eight hours of sleep. great. eight hours of sleep is probably a pretty good number for the average individual. but if you've ever looked at the bell curve distribution of sleep need in an adult, not to mention a child, it's quite vast.	eight hours
how do i cultivate better sleep hygiene in a shared space (i have flatmates)?	different types of cbt have been developed for specific problems such as depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. in addition, cbt for insomnia (cbt-i) has a proven track record in reducing sleeping problems. a large clinical trial also showed that cbt-i could reduce symptoms of many mental health conditions, improving emotional well-being and decreasing psychotic episodes. whether and how types of cbt can be combined or sequenced to address both sleep and mental health problems is subject to ongoing research, but for many patients, help from a trained counselor to reframe their thinking can meaningfully improve both their sleep and mental state. a common cause of sleeping problems is poor sleep hygiene. stepping up sleep hygiene by cultivating habits and a bedroom setting that are conducive to sleep can go a long way in reducing sleep disruptions. finding the best routines and bedroom arrangement may take some trial and error to determine what's best for you, but that process can pay dividends in helping you fall asleep quickly and stay asleep through the night.	cultivating habits
what is the optimal sleeping position?	pressure relief is highly dependent on your body type and sleeping position, so no single mattress is optimal for every sleeper. however, certain models tend to perform better in this area, and you can narrow down your options by understanding what you need in a mattress. we'll take an in-depth look at how pressure relief works and explain what you need to know to find the best mattress for you. mattresses that evenly disperse body weight and prevent sore spots are said to relieve pressure. pressure relief is strongly tied to mattress firmness, and most sleepers find models with some contouring ideal.	no single mattress is optimal for every sleeper
what foods should i take to improve my sleep?	tracking my own sleep and movement is incredibly helpful in informing my day's activities. for example, i use data from my wearable to determine if i should push a little harder during my daily workout, or if i need to take it easier. plus, i truly appreciate the reminder to start winding down for sleep. i wondered if my daughter's experience would be the same. my daughter is like a typical nine-year-old, but with more energy. she's bright and bubbly some days, crabby and moody others, i asked if she thought it'd be fun if we strapped a wearable to her wrist 24/7.	easier
should i sleep with the lights turned on at night?	these should always be done in the same order. to make the routine even more effective, start winding down the household by dimming the lights and turning off screens in the lead-up to bed. the bedtime routine should culminate in a goodnight kiss and lights-out. you should leave the room while your child is sleepy but not asleep yet. this way they learn to fall asleep on their own, and they won't panic if they wake up in the middle of the night and find you gone. set a consistent bedtime that leaves enough time for your child to sleep the recommended amount of hours for their age.	you should leave the room while your child is sleepy but not asleep yet.
how to solve snoring?	light sleep can help our ability to solve problems, according to a recent study, suggesting this period of sleep supports creativity. researchers from the paris brain institute aimed to determine if the first few minutes of sleep, known as its first stage or the period of dozing off, fosters creative insight. earlier research has shown that deep sleep plays a role in memory association and other cognitive functions. in the study, participants learned how to solve a math problem and completed sample problems as quickly as possible. during a 20-minute break, participants sat comfortably in a room and were allowed to rest or fall asleep.	light sleep
what is melatonin	there is no standardized melatonin dosage chart by age or weight in the united states. additionally, there are no set guidelines for what time or how frequently children should take melatonin. consult your pediatrician to determine what dosage of melatonin and timing is right for your child. sleep is essential for children for a number of reasons. during sleep, the body releases growth hormones and repairs damaged tissue and muscle. appropriate sleep in children is linked to positive school performance. if your child is struggling to fall asleep or get sufficient sleep, talk to your healthcare provider.	there is no standardized melatonin dosage chart by age or weight
how does my mood affect my sleep?	together, we decided on the amazon halo. the halo is a relatively inexpensive fitness wearable that does not have a screen (score!) but tracks sleep. the halo comes in three default band colors: black, silver, and light pink. there are also a variety of both fabric and silicone replacement bands available in many different colors. we settled on the color unicorn, a soft fabric band with light aqua and pink. next, we downloaded the amazon halo app to my phone, and we were off! my expectation was that if my daughter's sleep scores were in the 90s - demonstrating that she cycled through four stages of sleep with optimal time spent in each - her mood, energy, and outlook for the day would be positive.	positive
does sleep affect my eating behaviour?	using a wearable can help us pay attention and make small adjustments to daily practices, like sticking to a bedtime routine. these adjustments can enormously impact our moods, attitudes, and cognitive function. using a wearable has helped me gain insight into and improve my sleep routines. my experience prompted me to wonder, if sleep-tracking wearables help adults make positive lifestyle adjustments, would sleep tracking be beneficial for children, too? as the editor-in-chief of sleep foundation, i eat, breathe, and sleep sleep! for this reason, i felt excited to see how a sleep-tracking wearable might impact my nine-year-old daughter.	i eat, breathe, and sleep sleep!
when should i have sex?	she agreed and even seemed excited. i hoped this at-home experiment would provide insight into what her day was going to look like. could we predict her next day according to her daily sleep scores, sleep graphs, and daily energy output? in our home, we have strict nighttime routines, complete with timepoints for activities like brushing teeth, ensuring we abide by bedtime. because i am hyper-aware of sleep routines, proper sleep hygiene, and what stages of my sleep cycle i should be in throughout the night and when, i wondered if i could apply the data gathered by a wearable to my daughter.	throughout the night and when
what kind of light should i use in my room to allow me have a better rest at night?	when i'm not rested, i'm grumpy, crabby, and generally unpleasant. and, like her mom, my little girl is, too - but i had lost sight of that before a wearable helped me remember. although we received a lot of new information from the wearable, we did not change much in my daughter's schedule - no cancelled weekend movie nights in favor of sleep on the weekends, for sure. she needs to be a kid and have those cheating-the-system moments! what this experiment really helped me understand, however, is how significantly sleep impacts her every day. it also taught me how to approach her during an off-day.	a wearable
if i dont own a smartphone, how can i track my sleep schedule	tracking my own sleep and movement is incredibly helpful in informing my day's activities. for example, i use data from my wearable to determine if i should push a little harder during my daily workout, or if i need to take it easier. plus, i truly appreciate the reminder to start winding down for sleep. i wondered if my daughter's experience would be the same. my daughter is like a typical nine-year-old, but with more energy. she's bright and bubbly some days, crabby and moody others, i asked if she thought it'd be fun if we strapped a wearable to her wrist 24/7.	data from my wearable
when do you usually sleep every day?	the normal amount of time that babies sleep depends on their age. the nsf recommends that newborns spend between 14 and 17 hours sleeping every day. because of the need for feeding, this sleep is usually broken up into a number of shorter periods. while the bulk of total sleep happens at night, it's rare for newborns to sleep through the night without waking up. to accommodate feeding, nighttime sleep segments, and daytime naps, parents often work to develop a rough structure or schedule for a newborn's day. parents should be aware that fluctuations in sleep patterns for newborns can occur and do not necessarily indicate a sleeping problem.	between 14 and 17 hours
how do i balance workload and sleep?	sf: so it's about creating a positive association with sleep and the bedroom, as opposed to a negative one, and creating the bedroom as a place they should look forward to. i think the problem that we have these days is that we're all doing too much. we have a 24/7 lifestyle, often becoming over-attached to technology and especially mobile phones. now we've got the work/life balance and work-from-home problem. we are working later into the night, and having time to ourselves and time for our kids becomes hard. it's hard to juggle that. i encourage all the clients who i work with to really plan it out: look at when you're going to give the time to your children, look at how you're fitting your life around their needs, and that you're getting the things that you need to relax and switch off at night, too.	we are working later into the night
why do i have muscle cramps at night, when i sleep?	even now there's a piece of research done recently that indicated it's regarded as masculine to be underslept. this is despite all the scientific evidence proving that a good night's sleep is vital to our short- and long-term health. people who sleep too much are looked down on. people who get the right amount of sleep, well why do you need that much? when i left university, i went into advertising, and i was highly stressed. i used alcohol to get to sleep, and then once i decided i didn't want to drink anymore, i couldn't get to sleep.	i used alcohol
what happens during nrem sleep	people who have had a nightmare quickly regain alertness and sometimes remember what they dreamed about, but people who experience a night terror do not remember a narrative cause and are unlikely to remember their night terror the next day. nightmares and night terrors also happen during different stages of sleep. whereas night terrors usually happen during deep nrem sleep non-rapid eye movement sleep, nightmares more often occur during the rapid eye movement stage that is more commonly associated with dreaming. most people do not physically move during nightmares unless they have rem sleep behavior disorder. by contrast, night terrors are characterized by physical behaviors like screaming and thrashing.	night terrors
is it okay to eat a full meal right before sleeping/taking a nap?	also, try not to overindulge at dinnertime, as eating larger meals can cause indigestion and interfere with sleep. drinking too many fluids can also cause you to wake up with the urge to urinate. although more research is required, many people believe a pre-bedtime snack might lead to nightmares, which is one more reason to avoid eating right before sleep. avoiding these common sleep disruptors may help you sleep more soundly. you can also help make up your sleep deficit by taking short naps during the day, or improve your slumber by taking melatonin supplements, which help regulate circadian rhythms. keeping tabs on your sleep hygiene and designing a healthy bedtime routine are also keys to better slumber. however, additional measures may be needed if the quality of your sleep does not improve. if you believe you are suffering from a sleep disorder, be sure to consult your doctor or a healthcare professional.	avoid eating right before sleep
should i be taking sleep inducing supplements to fall asleep faster?	although melatonin supplements are not approved as a sleep aid by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda), research suggests melatonin may improve sleep for some people. researchers continue to study the effect of melatonin supplementation for other disorders, such as cancer, heart problems, digestive disorders, and mental illnesses. researchers have had some success in using melatonin supplements to treat sleep problems in children, particularly children with accompanying conditions such as autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd), or eczema. studies show taking melatonin before bed may help these children fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer, though more research is needed.	studies show taking melatonin before bed may help these children fall asleep faster
should i sacrifice sleep for my studies?	tracking my own sleep and movement is incredibly helpful in informing my day's activities. for example, i use data from my wearable to determine if i should push a little harder during my daily workout, or if i need to take it easier. plus, i truly appreciate the reminder to start winding down for sleep. i wondered if my daughter's experience would be the same. my daughter is like a typical nine-year-old, but with more energy. she's bright and bubbly some days, crabby and moody others, i asked if she thought it'd be fun if we strapped a wearable to her wrist 24/7.	sleep
what is the minimum duration of sleep needed in order to function the next day?	we've all had a sleepless night and felt its effects the next day. tossing and turning in bed, waking up exhausted, and needing caffeine to get through the day takes a toll on your body and your mind. in order to remain in good health, most adults need to sleep at least seven hours per night on a regular basis. unfortunately, somewhere around 70 million people in the u.s. sleep loss can impair your ability to think, affect your mood throughout the day, and impact your body's ability to heal itself. in order to feel like your best self, it's important to know what factors might be keeping you awake, what you can do to fall back asleep, and how to improve sleep quality in general.	seven hours per night
can massage improve sleep quality?	getting the proper amount of sleep is a critical factor in maintaining your overall health. however, one-third of american adults report getting insufficient sleep on a regular basis. many people seek massages as a way to relax, manage stress, and promote better rest. massage therapy is used in the management of various health conditions, and it has relatively low risk. there are several types of massage, each of which offers unique benefits. we take a closer look at how massage therapy can be used to improve sleep quality. massage may help improve sleep in two primary ways.	massage may help improve sleep in two primary ways.
how much sleep do i need to recover from pulling all nighters?	these situations involve grave potential consequences from daytime sleepiness, microsleeps, impaired attention, decreased response time, and slowed thinking that can result from pulling an all-nighter. even if you know you shouldn't pull an all-nighter, you might wind up in a situation where there doesn't seem to be another option. these tips can help you stay awake when pulling an all-nighter. once you've made it through, the next challenge is to take the right steps to recover from an all-nighter. if you've survived an all-nighter and effectively recovered, it's time to look forward and think about how to prevent finding yourself in the same situation.	daytime
is it normal to go in and out of sleep?	separation anxiety is a major contributor to sleeping problems in toddlers. it can make them resistant to going to bed, cry out once they are in bed, or fail to get back to sleep if they wake up in the night. some separation anxiety is normal, but it's best for parents to avoid reinforcing it. an adjustment period is normal for children to get over separation anxiety. focusing on a good process for handling their worries can empower them to self-soothe and sleep well on their own. teething is an ongoing process that starts during infancy and can last through the toddler years.	fail to get back to sleep if they wake up in the night
why do i feel like i'm falling in my sleep?	i hope people find this funny and humorous, easy to read, but helpful. and even if it's not helpful for your child, if you've got a friend or a sister who's got a kid and you're reading this book and thinking, oh my god, this sounds like charlie, doesn't it? hey, steve, read this. does it remind you of charlie? it always comes better from a parent or a friend or a family member than it does the doctor. whenever i work with a sports team, i always tell people, look, the first thing i'm here to do is to create a culture where we talk about sleep.	create a culture where we talk about sleep.
do i still sense my surroundings when i am asleep?	she agreed and even seemed excited. i hoped this at-home experiment would provide insight into what her day was going to look like. could we predict her next day according to her daily sleep scores, sleep graphs, and daily energy output? in our home, we have strict nighttime routines, complete with timepoints for activities like brushing teeth, ensuring we abide by bedtime. because i am hyper-aware of sleep routines, proper sleep hygiene, and what stages of my sleep cycle i should be in throughout the night and when, i wondered if i could apply the data gathered by a wearable to my daughter.	hyper-aware
how does coffee affect sleep?	coffee drinking is widespread, especially in the united states. an estimated 75% of american adults drink coffee, and nearly 50% do so on a daily basis. coffee contains caffeine and other compounds that, together, increase alertness and improve mood. as a result, many people use coffee as part of their morning routines to help them feel awake and ready for the day. even though coffee is a stimulant, some people find drinking it does not give them the outcome they desire. we discuss the potential reasons coffee might seem to make you feel sleepy rather than alert, as well as what you can do to counteract these effects.	sleepy rather than alert
how to measure my sleep quality?	while our family chose the amazon halo for our experiment, there are numerous sleep trackers available that are appropriate for kids, such as the garmin vivofit jr. 2 and fitbit ace 2 and 3. the data these trackers provide can offer a new perspective on your child's daily and nightly routines and sleep quality. do i vote for every child being constantly analyzed for data? certainly not. you have to do what makes you and your family comfortable. wearables can be a gentle, fun, non-invasive way of gaining insight into your child's inner workings. and, hey, now my daughter wakes up every morning and asks, can i check my sleep score?. how much sleep do babies and kids need? do your children get enough sleep? is your child getting enough sleep? here's how to tell.	sleep trackers
do sleep disorders in the family predispose me for a sleep disorder?	only genetic testing can determine if you're predisposed to insomnia. most clinical doctors do not do genetic testing for sleep issues, but it is available through some consumer dna companies. however, an easier, albeit less scientific, route might be to ask your family members if they have trouble sleeping, or if they know of other family members who have insomnia. while you're at it, ask them for tips and tricks on improving sleep. since you're related, what works for them may also be helpful for you. if insomnia is keeping you up at night, try these strategies for better sleep.	most clinical doctors do not do genetic testing for sleep issues
what is good duration of rem sleep for a university student?	a new study from researchers at simon fraser university (sfu) explores the impact of the shift to remote learning and sleep health. the study finds that overall sleep health has been negatively impacted for many college students, due to the destabilization of the circadian clock - an internal 24 hour rhythm that resets with the sun's light and dark cycles. the study, conducted by sfu's circadian rhythms and sleep lab, followed 80 university students enrolled in the same remote, online course during the summer of 2020. the data collected was then tested against 452 students who had taken the same course prior to the pandemic (2009-2013), in a synchronous, in-person capacity.	24 hour
how to relax the mind before sleeping?	relaxation exercises may be a component of cbt and can break the cycle of worry and rumination. you may also want to try scheduling times to actively worry, as this may eliminate worrying time as you lay down for sleep. deep breathing, mindfulness meditation, and guided imagery are just a few approaches to relaxation that can help put your mind at-ease before bed or if you wake up during the night.	deep breathing
what is sleep apnea	sleep apnea is a common sleep disorder that causes a person to repeatedly stop breathing as they sleep. as a result of these breathing difficulties, people with sleep apnea often snore and may experience daytime tiredness, morning headaches, irritability, and difficulty concentrating. sleep apnea increases a person's risk for other health problems, like heart attack and stroke. because of its impact, people are often curious about what causes sleep apnea and if genetics play a role. researchers have identified genetic factors that contribute to a person's likelihood of developing obstructive sleep apnea (osa), a type of sleep apnea in which lapses in breathing are caused by physical airway blockages.	a common sleep disorder that causes a person to repeatedly stop breathing as they sleep
is it okay to sleep at any time as long as i sleep for 7-9 hours daily?	scientific research makes clear that sleep is essential at any age. sleep powers the mind, restores the body, and fortifies virtually every system in the body. but how much sleep do we really need in order to get these benefits? national sleep foundation guidelines advise that healthy adults need between 7 and 9 hours of sleep per night. babies, young children, and teens need even more sleep to enable their growth and development. people over 65 should also get 7 to 8 hours per night. knowing the general recommendations for how much sleep you need is a first step.	healthy adults need between 7 and 9 hours of sleep per night
what are the type of sleeping positions that affects the quality of sleep compared to other positions?	no one firmness level performs optimally for all sleepers. factors such as weight, body type, and preferred sleep position all influence what is comfortable and supportive for you. additionally, firmness is not the only performance factor to consider when choosing a mattress. other variables, such as durability, temperature neutrality, and responsiveness, can also influence overall comfort. since there is no universally accepted measurement for mattress firmness, each manufacturer may use its own system. however, a 10-point scale is common. our system can give you a clearer idea of how a mattress may feel and how the firmness compares to other models.	preferred sleep position

when should one take a nap?	generally speaking, kids should stop napping when they no longer need a nap to feel energized for a full day. many children will stop napping naturally. infants until one year of age will take naps 1-4 times per day. as the brain matures, fewer and fewer naps are required. by 18-24 months, children need only one nap each day. children who take early afternoon naps for a set duration of fewer than 60 minutes have been observed sleeping well at night. however, naps should not be shortened if the child is sleeping well at bedtime.	by 18-24 months
why do i experience muscle cramps when i sleep?	even now there's a piece of research done recently that indicated it's regarded as masculine to be underslept. this is despite all the scientific evidence proving that a good night's sleep is vital to our short- and long-term health. people who sleep too much are looked down on. people who get the right amount of sleep, well why do you need that much? when i left university, i went into advertising, and i was highly stressed. i used alcohol to get to sleep, and then once i decided i didn't want to drink anymore, i couldn't get to sleep.	alcohol
i have heard that different kinds of foods are suitable for consumption before sleeping. what are they?	while there are many different kinds of sleep disorders, many share some similar symptoms. scheduling a sleep specialist appointment or sleep study likely begins with your primary care doctor. feeling comfortable and safe with your doctor is important. this helps ensure that all of your symptoms and concerns are heard. you may have questions about what happens in a sleep study, and you should bring these questions up to your doctor during your visit. to prepare for your visit, consider tracking your sleep symptoms for a few weeks before your appointment. keep a journal or notepad by your bedside and record your symptoms, so when you meet with your doctor you have a record of your symptoms. it's easy to forget important pieces of information when you're pressed for time in the doctor's office, and this is a good way to make sure you relay all the important information about your sleep habits and symptoms.	sleep disorders
what is optimal sleep?	some older children may still be inclined to nap and can benefit from doing so. in a study in china, where it is often more culturally appropriate to nap, children in grades 4-6 who took frequent naps after lunch showed signs of better behavior, academic achievement, and overall happiness. the existing research about napping and optimal timing of sleep episodes is inconclusive and acknowledges that what's best for one child can change over time and may not be what's best for another child of the same age. for this reason, parents, teachers, and child care workers may be able to best encourage optimal sleep for kids by being flexible and understanding about naps.	flexible and understanding about naps
how does sleep affect my brain	this wearables experience changed me, maybe more than it changed my daughter. i found myself altering how i approached her right from the beginning of the day depending on how well she slept. if she didn't sleep well or i noticed a lot of nighttime disturbances in her graph, i would allow her more leeway. giving her the benefit of doubt seemed to ease the bumps we'd hit throughout our daytime hours together, and even allow us to have a quiet and calm drift into the evening. this insight into my daughter's nine-year-old brain made me realize something so simple: we're not that much different.	i found myself altering how i approached her
why do i need to close my eyes in order to sleep?	it's out in the open your hamstring hurts, let's talk about it so we can figure out we need to do something. but we don't sometimes talk about sleep in meaningful ways. so my hope is this book creates a conversation about it, because i don't think we can talk about it too much. and so when you're out with your friends, and you're talking about, my kid does this in his sleep and i read something about that one time, my hope is that this gets people talking, and moving in directions of finding that solution.	when you're out with your friends
how long can someone go without sleep yet still function properly?	most people have a natural sleep-wake cycle which, when working properly, allows them to sleep for approximately seven hours at night and stay awake for around seventeen hours during the day. the two primary factors controlling the sleep-wake cycle are the internal body clock and homeostatic sleep pressure. the internal clock is located in the brain's hypothalamus. using both a natural sense of time and environmental cues such as light exposure, our internal clock can determine the correct timing for our circadian rhythms. homeostatic sleep pressure represents how badly someone needs to sleep, so it generally starts low upon morning waking and rises the longer they go without sleep.	seven hours
does my sleep position affect the quality of my sleep?	together, we decided on the amazon halo. the halo is a relatively inexpensive fitness wearable that does not have a screen (score!) but tracks sleep. the halo comes in three default band colors: black, silver, and light pink. there are also a variety of both fabric and silicone replacement bands available in many different colors. we settled on the color unicorn, a soft fabric band with light aqua and pink. next, we downloaded the amazon halo app to my phone, and we were off! my expectation was that if my daughter's sleep scores were in the 90s - demonstrating that she cycled through four stages of sleep with optimal time spent in each - her mood, energy, and outlook for the day would be positive.	her mood, energy, and outlook for the day would be positive
how does one clear their sleep debt besides sleeping more?	short naps may help you feel more rested and finish your work day strong. most adults need approximately seven to nine hours of sleep each night. however, activities such as work, commuting, and socializing have been shown to reduce the overall amount of time people spend asleep, resulting in a sleep debt. sleep debt is the difference between how much sleep a person needs and how much they actually receive. napping is one way to reduce your sleep debt and its negative impacts. for example, a 10-minute power nap during the day may be enough to help you fight fatigue and sleepiness for up to two hours after your nap.	napping
how many hours of sleep is considered optimal?	for that reason, the guidelines list a range of hours for each age group. the recommendations also acknowledge that, for some people with unique circumstances, there's some wiggle room on either side of the range for acceptable, though still not optimal, amount of sleep. deciding how much sleep you need means considering your overall health, daily activities, and typical sleep patterns. start with the above-mentioned recommendations and then use your answers to these questions to home in on your optimal amount of sleep. to create these recommended sleep times, an expert panel of 18 people was convened from different fields of science and medicine.	not
how long can i use my phone before going to bed?	using a wearable can help us pay attention and make small adjustments to daily practices, like sticking to a bedtime routine. these adjustments can enormously impact our moods, attitudes, and cognitive function. using a wearable has helped me gain insight into and improve my sleep routines. my experience prompted me to wonder, if sleep-tracking wearables help adults make positive lifestyle adjustments, would sleep tracking be beneficial for children, too? as the editor-in-chief of sleep foundation, i eat, breathe, and sleep sleep! for this reason, i felt excited to see how a sleep-tracking wearable might impact my nine-year-old daughter.	nine
does sugary drink affects sleep?	a few studies have also found a strong link between sugary drinks and poor sleep, although sugary drinks often contain caffeine, which can impact sleep quality on its own. since most studies on diet and sleep have been observational, researchers have been unable to definitively pinpoint whether poor sleep leads to cravings for sugary foods, or whether sugary foods affect sleep. sleep deprivation alters the brain's reward system, making people more likely to indulge in foods that are high in sugar and fat. people who don't receive sufficient amounts of sleep are also more likely to consume more calories overall, eat the bulk of their food later in the day, and favor snacks over proper meals.	often contain caffeine, which can impact sleep quality on its own
why do i wake up in the middle of the night?	you might wonder, why do i keep waking up at 4 a.m.? waking up during the night is fairly common, with over 35% of people waking up during the night at least three times per week. environmental factors, such as a partner snoring, a change in the room temperature or a loud car driving by, may wake you up momentarily from sleep. usually, most people fall back asleep easily. if you are waking up at the same time each night or waking up frequently throughout the night and struggling with falling back asleep, it could be due to factors beyond your environment.	environmental factors
why are we aware of our surroundings when we sleep	what exactly is going on in our brain when we sleep? new research from the university of oulu in finland has revealed more about how brain activity changes during sleep and what that means for us. prior studies have shown how brain activity supports our long-term health by washing out potentially harmful materials from the fluid that surrounds our brain. the finland study, focusing on a sample of 25 healthy participants, is the first to home in on how activities such as brain pulsations work while we're sleeping. the results may help drive a correlation between dementia, including alzheimer's disease, and why we need sleep.	what exactly is going on in our brain
can too much sleep be a bad thing?	what is a bad sleeper? and how much of that is something that's artificially constructed in our mind versus somebody who truly has a sleep problem? so yeah, i think that parents play a big role in these types of things. left to their own devices and with a little bit of help, parents can learn to really guide their kids into better sleep patterns and recognize problems when they exist. on what he tells new parents. number one, your child sleeps, it's impossible not to. now, what might be happening is that your child is not sleeping in a way that's predictable and efficient.	your child is not sleeping in a way that's predictable and efficient.
what can i do to sleep better?	while our family chose the amazon halo for our experiment, there are numerous sleep trackers available that are appropriate for kids, such as the garmin vivofit jr. 2 and fitbit ace 2 and 3. the data these trackers provide can offer a new perspective on your child's daily and nightly routines and sleep quality. do i vote for every child being constantly analyzed for data? certainly not. you have to do what makes you and your family comfortable. wearables can be a gentle, fun, non-invasive way of gaining insight into your child's inner workings. and, hey, now my daughter wakes up every morning and asks, can i check my sleep score?. how much sleep do babies and kids need? do your children get enough sleep? is your child getting enough sleep? here's how to tell.	check my sleep score
how can i track the quality of my sleep?	using a wearable can help us pay attention and make small adjustments to daily practices, like sticking to a bedtime routine. these adjustments can enormously impact our moods, attitudes, and cognitive function. using a wearable has helped me gain insight into and improve my sleep routines. my experience prompted me to wonder, if sleep-tracking wearables help adults make positive lifestyle adjustments, would sleep tracking be beneficial for children, too? as the editor-in-chief of sleep foundation, i eat, breathe, and sleep sleep! for this reason, i felt excited to see how a sleep-tracking wearable might impact my nine-year-old daughter.	using a wearable
am i sleeping when i'm under anesthesia?	when i'm not rested, i'm grumpy, crabby, and generally unpleasant. and, like her mom, my little girl is, too - but i had lost sight of that before a wearable helped me remember. although we received a lot of new information from the wearable, we did not change much in my daughter's schedule - no cancelled weekend movie nights in favor of sleep on the weekends, for sure. she needs to be a kid and have those cheating-the-system moments! what this experiment really helped me understand, however, is how significantly sleep impacts her every day. it also taught me how to approach her during an off-day.	when i'm not rested
i can't fall asleep at night easily. what can i do about this?	you might wonder, why do i keep waking up at 4 a.m.? waking up during the night is fairly common, with over 35% of people waking up during the night at least three times per week. environmental factors, such as a partner snoring, a change in the room temperature or a loud car driving by, may wake you up momentarily from sleep. usually, most people fall back asleep easily. if you are waking up at the same time each night or waking up frequently throughout the night and struggling with falling back asleep, it could be due to factors beyond your environment.	due to factors beyond your environment
is obesity associated with lack of sleep	being overweight or obese is strongly associated with numerous cardiovascular and metabolic problems including hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, heart disease, heart attack, and stroke. an analysis of existing research found that lack of sleep is correlated with obesity. people who sleep less than seven hours per night are more likely to have a higher body mass index (bmi) or be obese. sleep helps regulate the hormones that control hunger, and lack of sleep or sleep disturbances can trigger overeating and boost the desire for high-calorie foods. type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition in which the level of blood sugar, also known as blood glucose, is too high due to the body's inability to process sugar properly.	lack of sleep is correlated with obesity
should i seek a health professional if i cannot sleep at night?	elements of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (cbt-i) may be helpful when sleep problems are tied to short-term stressors. general sleep hygiene is crucial, but managing stress may be just as important. for many people, incorporating a few lifestyle changes can help reduce stress and improve sleep. however, anyone with concerns about stress or sleep may benefit from working with a professional. if you decide to seek treatment, your primary care physician may recommend their own care plan or refer you to a mental health specialist. if you feel overwhelmed by stress or are having thoughts about suicide, you should contact the national suicide prevention lifeline. confidential support is available 24 hours a day, every day of the week. for immediate emergencies, call 911.	your primary care physician may recommend their own care plan
how much sleep is too much sleep?	although sleep needs vary among children, the national sleep foundation provides guidelines for how many hours babies and toddlers should sleep during each 24-hour period. if you are concerned that your baby sleeps too much or too little, contact your pediatrician. expert guidelines outline how much babies should sleep during both day and night. for this reason, how much a baby should nap largely depends on how much they sleep at night. babies should nap as many hours as needed to get sufficient sleep in a 24-hour period. for example, guidelines recommend that 6-month-olds should sleep 12 to 16 hours a day, so if they sleep eight hours at night, they should nap around four to eight hours during the day.	how many hours
can i take afternoon naps after 3pm?	a brief nap can be refreshing and restorative, especially if you are sleep deprived, but longer naps late in the day can negatively impact your sleep quality and duration. a primary key to taking a successful nap comes down to timing. for most people, the ideal nap lasts 10 to 20 minutes. studies have also shown the best time to take a nap is in the early to mid-afternoon, when most people experience a natural decline in energy and alertness. homeostatic sleep pressure, also known as your sleep drive, is a reason why you feel energized after waking up and gradually become more tired as the day progresses.	early to mid-afternoon
how does sleep affect relationship with others?	it does not reveal other important elements about that breathing event which could point to the severity of your osa. for example, it does not show how that pause in breathing affects your blood oxygen levels, which, when repeatedly decreased over time, may increase your risk of related conditions like hypertension and diabetes. the ahi also does not measure how long an apnea or hypopnea lasts; only that it occurs for at least 10 seconds. people with apneas lasting 30 seconds may experience greater consequences than people whose apneas last 10 seconds. since the ahi represents an average taken across the night, it does not reveal patterns in breathing from hour to hour, or connections between sleep position and apneic events.	connections between sleep position and apneic events
how does my sleep affect my mood?	together, we decided on the amazon halo. the halo is a relatively inexpensive fitness wearable that does not have a screen (score!) but tracks sleep. the halo comes in three default band colors: black, silver, and light pink. there are also a variety of both fabric and silicone replacement bands available in many different colors. we settled on the color unicorn, a soft fabric band with light aqua and pink. next, we downloaded the amazon halo app to my phone, and we were off! my expectation was that if my daughter's sleep scores were in the 90s - demonstrating that she cycled through four stages of sleep with optimal time spent in each - her mood, energy, and outlook for the day would be positive.	her mood, energy, and outlook for the day would be positive
what is a good sleeping posture?	while each person has unique preferences, understanding the role weight plays in the sleep experience can help you decide what's best for you. across weight groups, sleepers usually prefer a mattress that balances contouring and support to ease pressure while promoting good posture. to achieve this, sleepers who weigh less usually need a softer mattress, while those who weigh more require firmer support. weight distribution can also influence firmness preferences. for instance, the weight of a tall person is spread over a much larger surface area than that of a short individual. therefore, the same mattress may feel firmer to a tall sleeper than it would to a short sleeper of the same weight.	mattress
should i take melatonin supplements	both adults and older adults should try starting with the lowest possible amount of melatonin and slowly increasing as needed while being mindful of side effects. most experts recommend limiting melatonin to short-term use. there is not enough information available on the side effects of melatonin supplements to determine if pregnant or breastfeeding people can safely take these supplements. those who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant should avoid melatonin supplements unless directed by their physician. if you are struggling with sleep, ask your doctor for other ways to improve sleep during pregnancy. melatonin may be safe to use short-term for most children and adolescents, but you should always talk to your pediatrician before giving your child melatonin for the first time.	those who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant should avoid melatonin supplements
is melatonin pills effective in improving sleep?	aasm recommends against the use of over-the-counter sleeping pills and dietary supplements like melatonin and valerian. potential side effects can vary based on the specific sleep aid and whether the person taking it has any other health problems or medications that they take. in general, there are potential negative effects that can occur with almost all sleep medications, although the likelihood of these effects may be higher with some sleep aids. in addition to this general list of potential side effects, there are risks that exist only with some sleep aids. for example, some sleeping pills may have detrimental effects on other health conditions.	against
what does lack of sleep do?	sleep is essential to the well-being of children. not only does sleep support the overall health of the child, but it also affects a child's mood and his or her ability to learn during the daytime. a lack of sleep can have long-term impacts on a child's future academic performance and emotional health. as infants and children grow, the amount of daily sleep they need decreases. these sleep needs are initially distributed between naps and nighttime sleep, but at what age should kids stop napping? the exact age varies among children, depending on factors such as attending preschool, maturity, and nighttime sleep habits.	long-term impacts on a child's future academic performance and emotional health
how long should i condition myself before going to sleep?	this wearables experience changed me, maybe more than it changed my daughter. i found myself altering how i approached her right from the beginning of the day depending on how well she slept. if she didn't sleep well or i noticed a lot of nighttime disturbances in her graph, i would allow her more leeway. giving her the benefit of doubt seemed to ease the bumps we'd hit throughout our daytime hours together, and even allow us to have a quiet and calm drift into the evening. this insight into my daughter's nine-year-old brain made me realize something so simple: we're not that much different.	how well she slept
will certain fragrence (e.g. lavender fragrance) be helpful for our sleep or will it impair some aspects of our sleep?	some of the best bedroom colors for sleep include the slate blue of a cloudy sky, bluish lavender, soft grey, or even a creamy white with slight blue undertones. warmer tones should be used only as subtle accents. don't forget about light when optimizing your bedroom for better sleep. while blue-toned paint is good, blue light from electronics and certain light bulbs is not. it's the part of the visible spectrum that has the most impact on your natural sleep-wake cycles and avoiding it may improve your sleep significantly. artificial blue light may have this effect on our sleep-wake cycles because it mimics the effects of sunlight on our circadian rhythms.	avoiding it may improve your sleep significantly
how long should i sleep for?	sf: so it's about creating a positive association with sleep and the bedroom, as opposed to a negative one, and creating the bedroom as a place they should look forward to. i think the problem that we have these days is that we're all doing too much. we have a 24/7 lifestyle, often becoming over-attached to technology and especially mobile phones. now we've got the work/life balance and work-from-home problem. we are working later into the night, and having time to ourselves and time for our kids becomes hard. it's hard to juggle that. i encourage all the clients who i work with to really plan it out: look at when you're going to give the time to your children, look at how you're fitting your life around their needs, and that you're getting the things that you need to relax and switch off at night, too.	we are working later into the night
how can utilizing a digital wearable positively affect my sleep?	using a wearable can help us pay attention and make small adjustments to daily practices, like sticking to a bedtime routine. these adjustments can enormously impact our moods, attitudes, and cognitive function. using a wearable has helped me gain insight into and improve my sleep routines. my experience prompted me to wonder, if sleep-tracking wearables help adults make positive lifestyle adjustments, would sleep tracking be beneficial for children, too? as the editor-in-chief of sleep foundation, i eat, breathe, and sleep sleep! for this reason, i felt excited to see how a sleep-tracking wearable might impact my nine-year-old daughter.	improve my sleep routines
can i split up my sleep into segments so i don't have to sleep for continuously 8 hours at night?	i was never told that sleep was important, was never encouraged to do it, and i was never educated on it. in fact, if i had behaved properly and if i'd have done well at school, i could stay up late at night to watch the midweek sport, so i was getting rewarded for losing sleep. and by the time i got to my teenage years, i was allowed to play in a band midweek until midnight. my dad was a former semi-pro musician, so i was encouraged to follow that, and i'd be the kid at the back of the class falling asleep.	i could stay up late at night
can i exercise before i sleep	a regular exercise routine can positively impact your sleep. by physically tiring out your body, it may be easier to fall asleep at night. if you can, perform your exercise outside, early in the morning or day. the morning sunlight can also positively impact your sleep and mood, by affecting your circadian rhythm. medications may help relieve insomnia and related conditions by inhibiting arousal. some sleep aids can have serious side effects, so it is always important to consult your doctor before using one. cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (cbt-i) is considered the most effective treatment for insomnia.	if you can, perform your exercise outside, early in the morning or day
is there a way of traning myself to gain more rem sleep within a limited sleep duration?	researchers have observed a significant effect on sleep for children who use electronic devices in their bedroom within two hours of bedtime. screen time within this window has been linked to inadequate sleep duration, poor quality sleep, and excessive daytime sleepiness the following day. in addition to restricting screen time before bed, parents may want to consider limiting their child's overall electronic device use. as little as 90 minutes of screen time in the evening can elevate feelings of alertness and make falling asleep more difficult for kids. it's important for children to only use their bed for sleeping - otherwise they have a hard time associating their bed with sleep.	restricting screen time before bed
how does late night snacks affect my overall sleep?	however, other research has found that pseudoephedrine doesn't negatively impact sleep quality. to find out if a certain medication you are taking can interfere with sleep, check the accompanying patient information or contact your doctor or pharmacist. busy schedules and long days may necessitate eating a late dinner or snacking on comfort foods in the evening. be aware that these late-night snacks can wreak havoc on your sleep. eating later in the evening can disrupt your circadian rhythm and increase symptoms of sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea. to help ensure optimal rest, avoid eating near bedtime.	can wreak havoc
how to treat insomia	increased melatonin levels provoke tiredness, helping us feel ready for sleep. melatonin is not a sedative, however, and the sleepiness it causes usually occurs about two hours after its levels increase, whether naturally or through supplementation. most research on melatonin focuses on how it affects the sleep-wake cycle, but this hormone likely impacts many other aspects of the body as well. limited research suggests melatonin could potentially help treat liver injuries and disease, protect against skin damage, prevent and treat cancer, treat dental disease, improve physical performance, and treat cardiovascular disease. melatonin appears to be involved in multiple bodily systems, so future research will likely uncover even more of its effects.	prevent and treat cancer
what is the best way to reduce the frequency of night time wake-ups?	the times of day and night when you wake up and fall asleep make a significant difference to your sleep quality. maintaining regular bedtimes that are appropriate for your schedule can help you wake up feeling refreshed and minimize daytime sleepiness. we discuss the best times to sleep and wake up based on the natural sleep-wake cycle. the best time to sleep is at night, roughly between midnight and 7 a.m. although exact sleep-wake times can vary from person to person, humans generally evolved to be active during the day. this preference is reinforced by exposure to bright light during daytime hours and reduced levels of light at night.	exposure to bright light
does screentime before sleep affect my time to fall asleep?	one study noted that participants who exercised in the morning fell asleep faster at night, while those who worked out before bed stayed asleep longer. another found that vigorous exercise before bed increased heart rate, making it difficult to fall asleep. a third study determined that exercise timing does not affect sleep quality at all. in general, it is fine to work out at any time of day. that said, some researchers suggest that you should stop exercising at least 90 minutes before sleep. this time allows heart rate to slow down and body temperature to return to normal.	difficult to fall asleep
does polyphasic sleep actually work?	others who work unusual hours or jobs that require near-constant alertness may also follow this sleeping pattern. some claim polyphasic sleep schedules are preferable to monophasic sleep schedules and provide more cognitive benefits, but research does not support these claims. there are potential benefits and side effects of polyphasic sleep schedules to consider before changing routines. polyphasic sleep is marked by multiple intervals of sleep and wakefulness throughout the 24-hour day. polyphasic sleep patterns are not uncommon in the animal kingdom. many creatures engage in polyphasic sleep patterns, such as mice. polyphasic sleep is not the norm for most humans, who usually engage in monophasic sleep, or sleep in one large block of time each day.	marked by multiple intervals of sleep and wakefulness throughout the 24-hour day
is nap a friend or foe?	sometimes losing sleep is unavoidable. whether it's due to a demanding work schedule or a late night with family or friends, it's important to have a plan for recovering from lost sleep. fortunately, with a little patience and consistency, people can recover from sleep debt and regain the benefits of being well slept. taking a nap is often the first thing that comes to mind when we're underslept, and for good reason. a brief, 10 to 20 minute nap may help you feel more refreshed during the day. a mid-afternoon nap can increase working memory, learning, and mental acuity for a few hours.	family or friends
can we make up for sleep at weekends after deprivation in weekdays?	going to bed a little earlier on weekends can help you recoup sleep debt without sleeping in too late and throwing off your circadian rhythm. you sleep more deeply when you're sleep-deprived, so just a little extra sleep can make a big difference. the best test is to pay attention to how you feel when you sleep in on weekends. do you feel awake and alert, or do you feel groggy and grumpy? if you feel refreshed and restored after sleep, then what you're doing is working. if you don't feel your best, it may be worth adjusting your weekend sleep schedule to align with your weekday schedule.	it may be worth adjusting your weekend sleep schedule
how do i reduce the number of times i wake up during sleep?	i definitely do not advise parents letting them cry themselves to sleep. i encourage babies to be comforted and soothed. i would start by having parents teach a baby how to self-soothe. so for example, never put a baby down asleep. the aim here is to put your baby down to sleep, aware of their surroundings and drowsy. the goal is to put babies down almost asleep, so that they learn the ability to fall asleep on their own. babies get mini sleeps - when they wake up, they need to have the opportunity to get back to sleep on their own.	they need to have the opportunity to get back to sleep on their own
why do i always wake up very early?	sleep disturbances following a concussion may differ from person to person, and they do not always indicate the severity or type of concussion. approximately 30% to 80% of people develop some kind of sleep problems after a concussion. it's common to feel very sleepy and take extra naps the first week after a concussion, then have trouble sleeping in the following weeks. you may continue to feel tired during the day if you are having trouble falling asleep at night or waking up early and unable to get back to sleep. daytime sleepiness after a concussion might also be due to a problem with the mechanisms that regulate your sleep-wake cycle, leading you to feel sleepy at unusual times.	unable to get back to sleep
what is sleep apnea?	sleep apnea is a common sleep disorder that causes a person to repeatedly stop breathing as they sleep. as a result of these breathing difficulties, people with sleep apnea often snore and may experience daytime tiredness, morning headaches, irritability, and difficulty concentrating. sleep apnea increases a person's risk for other health problems, like heart attack and stroke. because of its impact, people are often curious about what causes sleep apnea and if genetics play a role. researchers have identified genetic factors that contribute to a person's likelihood of developing obstructive sleep apnea (osa), a type of sleep apnea in which lapses in breathing are caused by physical airway blockages.	a common sleep disorder
why am i not able to sleep?	when a person experiences fatigue, they often feel tired but do not usually fall asleep when they want to be awake. excessive sleepiness is often referred to as excessive daytime sleepiness, or eds, by physicians and sleep specialists. to eliminate or reduce your eds, you must first figure out why you are experiencing it. if you experience excessive sleepiness, you've probably asked yourself, why am i so sleepy during the day? there is no single, universal answer to that question because different people experience excessive daytime sleepiness (eds) for various reasons. if you don't have health or psychiatric problems that could be causing your eds, consider exploring the possibility of a sleep disorder.	different people experience excessive daytime sleepiness (eds) for various reasons

i am too busy to get enough sleep this week. will getting enough sleep next week help me offset my sleep debt this week?	heavy foods and alcohol can both interfere with the quality of your sleep, so you may want to sleep in later to make up for it. there is some evidence that sleeping in on weekends may recoup some sleep debt, but experts still recommend consistency as the best approach for healthy sleep. sleeping in on two days of the week may be better than not getting enough sleep for seven days, but if you get more sleep all week long, that's even better. try these tips to get more sleep during the week. sleeping in on the weekends can feel great, but it makes returning to early monday mornings even tougher. see if the tips above help you get more sleep during the week, and you may not need to sleep in so late on the weekend.	if you get more sleep all week long, that's even better
how can i reduce the frequency of waking up during sleep?	other parasomnias that happen most often during stage 3 sleep include sleep talking and night terrors. it is normal to wake up briefly several times during sleep and sleepers are usually unaware of these short arousals. however, too many disruptions can affect sleep quality and cause a sleeper to wake up feeling unrefreshed. sleep disruptions can also affect a person's sleep stages. whether from missing sleep or waking up too often during the night, the body makes up for lost sleep by spending more time in deep nrem sleep. after longer periods of sleep loss, a person may also experience an increase in rem sleep. sleep deprivation is only one of many factors that can alter how the body transitions through sleep stages. diet: certain food and drinks, including those that contain caffeine and alcohol, can reduce the time a sleeper spends in stage 3 sleep. while alcohol also reduces rem sleep early in the night, the body compensates with more rem sleep as the night goes on and the effects of alcohol wear off.	diet
what's the best time to exercise?	that said, some surveys have found the vast majority of people do not exercise in the hour before bedtime. one example is the national sleep foundation's 2005 sleep in america poll, which surveyed adults 18 and older. of these respondents, 4% said they exercised within an hour of bedtime on a nightly basis, 7% said they did so a few nights a week, and 5% said they exercised before bed a few nights per month. the remaining respondents either rarely or never exercised an hour before bedtime, or refused to answer. since survey results among people who exercise late at night have been variable, you should base your exercise times and intensity on what best suits your sleep schedule.	hour before bedtime
what is the recommended amount of caffeine in a day	it is recommended that those who are pregnant or breastfeeding should avoid coffee, or limit intake to 16 ounces or less per day (about two cups of coffee). during pregnancy, caffeine can be passed to the baby through the placenta. a trace amount of caffeine can also be found in breast milk. if you are pregnant or breastfeeding and concerned about your caffeine intake, talk to your health care provider about what steps you should take to ensure optimum health for you and your baby. caffeine can impact the onset of sleep and reduce sleep time, efficiency, and satisfaction levels.	16 ounces or less per day
how long should afternoon naps be	people nap for a variety of reasons. perhaps taking an afternoon siesta is part of your culture, or maybe you have noticed a midday nap helps you feel less stressed. however, busy work schedules do not always allow for long daytime breaks to retreat to bed. this is why many people are intrigued by the idea of the power nap. we explore this short nap, specifically designed for workers, and delve into how long a power nap should be, the benefits it provides, how it compares to drinking coffee for alertness, and tips for a better power nap.	how long
why do i feel tired even when i sleep such long hours?	even now there's a piece of research done recently that indicated it's regarded as masculine to be underslept. this is despite all the scientific evidence proving that a good night's sleep is vital to our short- and long-term health. people who sleep too much are looked down on. people who get the right amount of sleep, well why do you need that much? when i left university, i went into advertising, and i was highly stressed. i used alcohol to get to sleep, and then once i decided i didn't want to drink anymore, i couldn't get to sleep.	i was highly stressed
is sleeping the same as losing consciousness?	people who have trouble sleeping due to multiple concussions are also more likely to experience strong headaches and problems with mood and thinking. one study of concussions in children under 18 found that those who slept poorly had more severe symptoms and took more than two additional weeks to recover, compared to those who slept well. concussion symptoms vary, and you can have a concussion even if you do not lose consciousness. these symptoms might not show up right away. if you suspect you might have a concussion, it is very important to seek medical help, rest, and avoid activities that could cause another concussion before you are healed.	you can have a concussion even if you do not lose consciousness
what kind of diet will improve sleep quality?	it has been well established that high-carbohydrate meals often can make you feel drowsy. high-carbohydrate meals can also impair your sleep quality. in fact, high carbohydrate intake has been shown to increase the number of awakenings at night and reduce the amount of deep sleep you get. it is not a surprise that frequent consumption of energy drinks and sugar-sweetened beverages is associated with poor sleep quality. many different types of diets can offer this kind of nutritional balance, and some have been evaluated more closely for how they affect sleep. for example, the mediterranean diet, which is plant-based while incorporating lean meats and high-fiber foods, has been found to improve heart health and sleep quality.	mediterranean
does music help with sleep?	sleep sounds have been helping people fall asleep for years. it turns out music can help us sleep, too. over 60% of people listen to music to help themselves fall asleep. we explain how music can help you sleep, the best types of music for sleep, and tips for adding music to your sleep routine. studies have found that music can improve the sleep quality of people with chronic or short-term sleep problems. listening to music can help people fall asleep faster, wake up less often during the night, and feel better about their sleep overall.	music can help us sleep
are there any foods that i can consume that would help me to improve my sleep?	using a wearable can help us pay attention and make small adjustments to daily practices, like sticking to a bedtime routine. these adjustments can enormously impact our moods, attitudes, and cognitive function. using a wearable has helped me gain insight into and improve my sleep routines. my experience prompted me to wonder, if sleep-tracking wearables help adults make positive lifestyle adjustments, would sleep tracking be beneficial for children, too? as the editor-in-chief of sleep foundation, i eat, breathe, and sleep sleep! for this reason, i felt excited to see how a sleep-tracking wearable might impact my nine-year-old daughter.	i eat, breathe, and sleep sleep!
why do we lucid dream?	if you feel any confusion or uncertainty about whether or not lucid dreaming is safe for you, ask your doctor or mental health professional for advice. being aware of why you want to lucid dream can help you evaluate if lucid dreaming is working for you, or if you should let the practice go. people may feel interested in lucid dreaming for a variety of reasons, such as wanting to experience altered consciousness without taking drugs, or overcoming fears and becoming stronger psychologically. if you find that lucid dreams are not helping you achieve the goals you set out to achieve, then the benefits may not be worth the potential risks.	wanting to experience altered consciousness without taking drugs
how long should i nap during the day?	although sleep needs vary among children, the national sleep foundation provides guidelines for how many hours babies and toddlers should sleep during each 24-hour period. if you are concerned that your baby sleeps too much or too little, contact your pediatrician. expert guidelines outline how much babies should sleep during both day and night. for this reason, how much a baby should nap largely depends on how much they sleep at night. babies should nap as many hours as needed to get sufficient sleep in a 24-hour period. for example, guidelines recommend that 6-month-olds should sleep 12 to 16 hours a day, so if they sleep eight hours at night, they should nap around four to eight hours during the day.	four to eight hours
how is sleep wake regulated	caffeine, on the other hand, suppresses adenosine, which may explain part of how it promotes wakefulness. neurotransmitters are chemicals that send signals within the nervous system to activate or deactivate certain cells. examples of neurotransmitters involved in promoting wakefulness or sleep include gaba, acetylcholine, orexin, and serotonin. hormones also play an integral role in signaling and regulating sleep-wake states. melatonin, which promotes sleep and is naturally produced as light exposure decreases, is one of the best known hormones related to sleep. other important sleep-related hormones include adrenaline, cortisol, and norepinephrine. sleep can also affect the production of vital hormones, such as growth hormone as well as leptin and ghrelin that regulate appetite, which may exert influence on sleep-wake homeostasis and circadian rhythms.	hormones
what is the restless leg syndrome?	also known as willis-ekbom disease, restless leg syndrome has been described as both a neurological sensory disorder and a sleep movement disorder, characterized by uncomfortable sensations in the legs, usually when lying down, and an overwhelming urge to move them to experience relief. if you've experienced these symptoms, you should consult a doctor. there is no specific diagnostic test for restless leg syndrome. if you think you may have rls, you should schedule an appointment with your doctor. they will perform a thorough history and physical exam to determine what's causing your symptoms. other tests and studies may be required to rule out medical conditions presenting with similar symptoms.	willis-ekbom disease
i can't sleep in complete darkness because i'm afraid of the dark, yet my night light is keeping me awake, what should i do?	when i'm not rested, i'm grumpy, crabby, and generally unpleasant. and, like her mom, my little girl is, too - but i had lost sight of that before a wearable helped me remember. although we received a lot of new information from the wearable, we did not change much in my daughter's schedule - no cancelled weekend movie nights in favor of sleep on the weekends, for sure. she needs to be a kid and have those cheating-the-system moments! what this experiment really helped me understand, however, is how significantly sleep impacts her every day. it also taught me how to approach her during an off-day.	sleep on the weekends
how much exercise should i have in a week?	you should also document how you feel during the day, how often you exercise, and how much caffeine or alcohol you consume. the first step of an insomnia diagnosis usually consists of a medical exam and questionnaire. these components help the doctor determine whether your insomnia is an isolated condition, or if you're experiencing symptoms due to other underlying factors. they can also use these tests to rule out other sleep disorders such as sleep apnea. treatment for insomnia varies by specific diagnosis. for chronic insomnia, you may undergo six to eight weeks of cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt) to help you fall asleep faster and sleep without waking up during the night.	six to eight
are scents good for sleep?	scents can become part of emotional memory, recreating certain responses to smells when you encounter them again in the future. not surprisingly, some scents are commonly associated with a more inviting bedroom environment. in the national sleep foundation's 2012 bedroom poll, 78% of people said they were more excited for bed when their sheets had a fresh scent, and 71% of people described getting more comfortable sleep with fresh sheets. sheets, though, are just one source of bedtime fragrances, and there are indications that bringing other scents into the bedroom with aromatherapy may promote improved sleep. aromatherapy utilizes scents from plants to try to enhance different aspects of health.	indications that bringing other scents into the bedroom with aromatherapy may promote improved sleep
how does smoking affect my sleep?	it's out in the open your hamstring hurts, let's talk about it so we can figure out we need to do something. but we don't sometimes talk about sleep in meaningful ways. so my hope is this book creates a conversation about it, because i don't think we can talk about it too much. and so when you're out with your friends, and you're talking about, my kid does this in his sleep and i read something about that one time, my hope is that this gets people talking, and moving in directions of finding that solution.	my kid does this in his sleep
what kind of food helps me sleep better?	your doctor will need to ask questions and order tests to determine what is causing fatigue in your personal situation. preparing for your appointment can help it go more smoothly. tracking the frequency, timing, and severity of your symptoms might help your doctor better understand what you're experiencing. tracking your activity level and symptoms can also help you draw connections and learn your limits so that you can reduce flare-ups. when tracking your symptoms, remember to write down everything ailing you, not just fatigue. people with cfs/me often also have issues with pain, cognition, such as memory and concentration, and sleep.	cfs
does meditation help to sleep better?	headspace offers move mode workouts to help keep you active during the day, two to three-minute mini meditations, sos meditation sessions for panic or anxiety, and a tracking feature for meditation progress. although headspace's features may promote sleep, the app does not offer any type of alarm system or sleep tracking. headspace is available for download on both ios and android devices. this app fully integrates with apple health, allowing people to track their time spent meditating in the same place they track other health information. the yours app takes a multifaceted approach to helping you sleep better at night.	helping you sleep better at night.
is it normal to wake up in the middle of the night before sleeping again? (biphasic sleep)	sleep latency - the time it takes to fall asleep - may also increase. some studies suggest that, beginning in middle age, the average person loses 27 minutes of sleep per night for each subsequent decade. these decreases in sleep quality and duration are tied to the body's internal timekeeping systems. the body cannot process circadian signals as efficiently, which in turn may cause older people to go to bed and wake up at earlier times. our sleep architecture also changes as we age. a normal sleep cycle is divided into four stages. these include two stages of light non-rapid eye movement (nrem) sleep, one stage of heavy or slow-wave nrem sleep, and a final stage of rapid eye movement (rem) sleep before the cycle begins again.	the body cannot process circadian signals as efficiently
why is sleep important ?	managing non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder also requires following healthy sleep hygiene practices to reinforce circadian cues. it's important to follow your doctor's treatment plan, but it's also imperative to tell your doctor if a treatment plan isn't working for you, so that they can make adjustments as necessary. it may help to ask for a referral to a sleep specialist with a better understanding of circadian rhythm disorders. explaining non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder to your friends and family can help them understand why you may appear tired or disinterested, or why you sometimes aren't able to meet commitments. tell them about your experience with n24swd, perhaps explaining your history of symptoms, such as falling asleep at inappropriate times or feeling irritated due to sleep deprivation.	to follow your doctor's treatment plan
scientifically speaking, is white noise helpful for obtaining better sleep?	in the u.s., over one-third of adults and children fall short on sleep. sleep deprivation can increase a person's risk for a variety of chronic ailments, including diabetes, obesity, and depression. for this reason, people are often looking for tools, like a white noise machine, to help them sleep better or fall asleep faster. we explore what white noise is, how it impacts sleep, and how to incorporate it into your nightly routine if you want to try listening to it. white noise refers to a noise that contains all frequencies across the spectrum of audible sound in equal measure.	tools
what food should i eat to improve my sleep quality	she agreed and even seemed excited. i hoped this at-home experiment would provide insight into what her day was going to look like. could we predict her next day according to her daily sleep scores, sleep graphs, and daily energy output? in our home, we have strict nighttime routines, complete with timepoints for activities like brushing teeth, ensuring we abide by bedtime. because i am hyper-aware of sleep routines, proper sleep hygiene, and what stages of my sleep cycle i should be in throughout the night and when, i wondered if i could apply the data gathered by a wearable to my daughter.	throughout the night and when
can i sleep 2x 4 hours sleep instead?	as we sleep, we regain homeostasis and our sleep drive diminishes. finally, our need for alertness grows, telling us that it's time to wake up. if sleep/wake homeostasis alone regulated our sleep drive, we'd likely find ourselves yo-yoing between sleep and alertness throughout each day. we'd also likely feel most alert in the morning, with that alertness wearing off the longer we were awake. instead, we can feel just as alert at 4:00 p.m. as we might have felt at 10:00 a.m., even when we've been awake for hours. that's because sleep/wake homeostasis doesn't work alone in regulating our sleep schedule; our circadian rhythm also plays a role.	we can feel just as alert at 4:00 p.m.
there was one period of time i dreamt a lot, was i not getting quality sleep?	you know why would that be? one theory could be, maybe that child is excessively sleepy, and you've made him less so with that medication. i think back to when my first child was born. we came home, we put her in that little chair that kind of bounces. it's got a little angle, and i remember sitting there and we looked at each other like, well, god now what? we're pretty smart people. but i think when it comes to sleep and our kids, we don't really get a lot of instruction. it's something we talk a lot about, but not in ways that might be particularly helpful for parents.	we don't really get a lot of instruction
what should i do if i cannot fall asleep?	i was never told that sleep was important, was never encouraged to do it, and i was never educated on it. in fact, if i had behaved properly and if i'd have done well at school, i could stay up late at night to watch the midweek sport, so i was getting rewarded for losing sleep. and by the time i got to my teenage years, i was allowed to play in a band midweek until midnight. my dad was a former semi-pro musician, so i was encouraged to follow that, and i'd be the kid at the back of the class falling asleep.	i'd be the kid at the back of the class
what can i do to improve my excessive daytime sleepiness?	you know why would that be? one theory could be, maybe that child is excessively sleepy, and you've made him less so with that medication. i think back to when my first child was born. we came home, we put her in that little chair that kind of bounces. it's got a little angle, and i remember sitting there and we looked at each other like, well, god now what? we're pretty smart people. but i think when it comes to sleep and our kids, we don't really get a lot of instruction. it's something we talk a lot about, but not in ways that might be particularly helpful for parents.	we don't really get a lot of instruction
why is the quality of sleep important?	some researchers believe that many women have increased sleep quantity as an attempt to compensate for reduced sleep quality. it's important to remember that sleep can vary considerably from person to person and is influenced by a wide range of factors. studies showing differences in sleep quantity or quality reflect an aggregate; they don't mean that all women sleep more or have lower-quality sleep than men. there are both sex- and gender-based factors that influence how and why men and women sleep differently. sex-based factors relate to underlying biology including hormone production, sleep cycles, and circadian rhythm.	influenced by a wide range of factors
how long should i exercise each day	record when you went to sleep and when you woke up, how long you slept overall, how frequently you awoke during the night, how long it took you to fall back asleep, and any other symptoms you experienced. it can also be helpful to note what you ate or drank each day and when you exercised. a sleep diary can be an important tool in helping your doctor get to the root of your problem, as it helps you provide your doctor with a more accurate assessment of your sleep issues. when people are asked questions about their insomnia, they're more likely to exaggerate their symptoms.	ate or drank each day
what type of sports can help for sleep?	it is a risk factor for substance abuse and mental health problems, as well as more immediate problems such as car crashes and sports injuries. sleep needs change as your child grows older, but whether you're dealing with a 2-year-old toddler or a stubborn teenager, research shows that a consistent bedtime routine is helpful for making sure your child gets enough sleep. whatever activities you choose, try to do the same ones every day in the same order so your child knows what to expect. the best time to put your child to bed is when they're sleepy, not when they're already asleep.	whatever activities
how does exercise improve sleep	numerous studies have shown that, generally, exercise improves sleep. but, exercise may impact the body differently depending on the time of day a person exercises. we look at the benefits and drawbacks of working out before bed and discuss the best time to exercise for a good night's sleep. when giving sleep hygiene advice, experts often warn that late afternoon and evening exercise can disrupt sleep. some sleep researchers speculate that, as a result, many individuals who are unable to exercise earlier in the day may skip workouts altogether. however, a growing body of evidence suggests that working out before bed does not make it harder for most adults to fall asleep and may even help some get better rest.	exercise improves sleep
how does exercising affect how well i sleep?	this wearables experience changed me, maybe more than it changed my daughter. i found myself altering how i approached her right from the beginning of the day depending on how well she slept. if she didn't sleep well or i noticed a lot of nighttime disturbances in her graph, i would allow her more leeway. giving her the benefit of doubt seemed to ease the bumps we'd hit throughout our daytime hours together, and even allow us to have a quiet and calm drift into the evening. this insight into my daughter's nine-year-old brain made me realize something so simple: we're not that much different.	altering how i approached her
sometimes i will wake up several times in the middle of sleep, what are some ways i can prevent this?	cbt-i is often provided by a doctor, counselor, therapist, or psychiatrist trained in this form of treatment. practitioners with experience in cbt-i can be found through professional organizations such as the society of behavioral sleep medicine and the american board of sleep medicine. unfortunately, due to the widespread need for this treatment, there aren't enough cbt-i professionals to meet the current demand. in response, researchers have developed new ways of offering cbt-i, such as digital, group, and self-help formats. several digital cbt-i (sometimes called dcbt-i or dcbt) applications have been developed in order to adapt to this trend, reduce the cost of treatment, and offer the benefits of cbt-i to a wider audience.	digital, group, and self-help formats
why does coffee make you feel more alert	coffee drinking is widespread, especially in the united states. an estimated 75% of american adults drink coffee, and nearly 50% do so on a daily basis. coffee contains caffeine and other compounds that, together, increase alertness and improve mood. as a result, many people use coffee as part of their morning routines to help them feel awake and ready for the day. even though coffee is a stimulant, some people find drinking it does not give them the outcome they desire. we discuss the potential reasons coffee might seem to make you feel sleepy rather than alert, as well as what you can do to counteract these effects.	sleepy rather than alert
do you use healthy device to detect your sleep?	home sleep tests are simplified versions that you can use to diagnose sleep apnea at home. the kit will include equipment to monitor your blood oxygen levels, breathing patterns, and heart rate. if the results are abnormal, your doctor may proceed with recommending treatment. if your results are normal, they may then recommend a polysomnogram. this is because home sleep tests may underestimate osa severity and are not the best at detecting rare types of sleep apnea, such as central sleep apnea. if your doctor diagnoses you with obstructive sleep apnea, they may recommend continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) therapy or another oral device for you to wear at night.	oral device for you to wear at night
how does stress affect my sleep?	it's out in the open your hamstring hurts, let's talk about it so we can figure out we need to do something. but we don't sometimes talk about sleep in meaningful ways. so my hope is this book creates a conversation about it, because i don't think we can talk about it too much. and so when you're out with your friends, and you're talking about, my kid does this in his sleep and i read something about that one time, my hope is that this gets people talking, and moving in directions of finding that solution.	my kid does this in his sleep
could daytime naps compensate for my irregular sleeping hours?	this disorder is characterized by inconsistent sleep patterns without a stable rhythm or entrainment to day-night cycles. abnormal sleep periods can cause both difficulty sleeping and excessive daytime sleepiness during the course of the day. most people with irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder have neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative disorder, such as parkinson's disease, alzheimer's disease, or huntington's disease. the disorder has also been observed in children with developmental disabilities. the fragmented sleep cycle of this disorder typically yields periods of sleep that last four hours or less. as a result, people with irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder frequently nap throughout the day.	frequently nap throughout the day
when do you think it's a correct time to sleep	certainly all the research suggests, even with teenagers, that if you set them a bedtime they are more likely to get more sleep. so even when teenagers want to rule their own lives, giving them a bedtime is the way to go. sf: the stereotype of the teenager is one who stays up late and wakes up late; their circadian rhythm just shifts later, all-around. is that something we should be mindful of, or work to correct? or is that just what our bodies do when we're adolescents? dg: i think the western world does teenage students a disservice.	if you set them a bedtime
do i have to adjust my sleeping schedule before travels across multiple time zones?	people may want to change their circadian rhythms and sleep-wake cycles for different reasons. some need adjustments after starting a job that requires them to work late at night or early in the morning. others find that early riser or night owl schedules do not provide enough sleep each day, and would like to adopt a healthier sleep routine. if you're about to travel across multiple time zones, acclimating to the local time can help minimize the effects of jet lag. genes or late nights working the graveyard shift may incline your circadian rhythm one way or another.	acclimating to the local time
how can i fall asleep faster?	fortunately, effective treatments are available that can help people fall asleep faster, stay asleep, and feel more rested during the day. cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (cbt-i or cbti) is a short, structured, and evidence-based approach to combating the frustrating symptoms of insomnia. cbt-i focuses on exploring the connection between the way we think, the things we do, and how we sleep. during treatment, a trained cbt-i provider helps to identify thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that are contributing to the symptoms of insomnia. thoughts and feelings about sleep are examined and tested to see if they're accurate, while behaviors are examined to determine if they promote sleep.	effective treatments
how should i dress for an optimal night sleep?	dressing your baby for sleep may seem simple compared to trying to get them to sleep through the night. however, there are several important considerations to take into account. a baby should sleep in clothing intended for infant sleep in order to stay warm at night, since babies are not supposed to sleep with blankets or bedding apart from tight-fitted bed sheets. for example, babies often sleep in sleep sacks and onesies. the american academy of pediatrics (aap) recommends dressing babies in clothes similar to what an adult would feel comfortable wearing in the same temperature.	clothing intended for infant sleep
what time should i should stop studying for sleep?	heavy drinking means more than 15 drinks per week for men and more than eight drinks per week for women. will a small amount of alcohol affect my sleep? drinking to excess will probably have a more negative impact on sleep than light or moderate alcohol consumption. however, since the effects of alcohol are different from person to person, even small amounts of alcohol can reduce sleep quality for some people. one 2018 study compared sleep quality among subjects who consumed different amounts of alcohol. when should i stop drinking prior to bed to minimize sleep disruption? to reduce the risk of sleep disruptions, you should stop drinking alcohol at least four hours before bedtime.	four hours before bedtime
when do your friends usually sleep?	understanding sleep procrastination, including its symptoms, causes, and consequences, can help you recognize when you're engaging in it. then, you can take steps to prevent bedtime procrastination from leading to insufficient sleep. bedtime procrastination behaviors reflect procrastination in other contexts, such as avoiding doing homework or household chores. procrastinating on sleep doesn't usually generate negative associations like those other obligations, however. instead, sleep may be curtailed in favor of activities that offer more immediate enjoyment, such as watching tv, spending time with friends, or playing video games. sleep procrastination can take different forms. one form involves delaying the act of getting into bed (bedtime procrastination).	watching tv, spending time with friends, or playing video games
how does the environment around me plays a significant role for me to fall asleep?	when i'm not rested, i'm grumpy, crabby, and generally unpleasant. and, like her mom, my little girl is, too - but i had lost sight of that before a wearable helped me remember. although we received a lot of new information from the wearable, we did not change much in my daughter's schedule - no cancelled weekend movie nights in favor of sleep on the weekends, for sure. she needs to be a kid and have those cheating-the-system moments! what this experiment really helped me understand, however, is how significantly sleep impacts her every day. it also taught me how to approach her during an off-day.	sleep impacts her every day
why does napping make me feel more tired?	when you feel tired, a good night's sleep can usually help you feel refreshed. in contrast, fatigue is a prolonged feeling of tiredness and lack of energy that typically isn't resolved by sleeping. as much as 50% of the people report symptoms of fatigue at some point. fatigue is common after sleep deprivation, long periods of stress, and physical activity. however, fatigue can also be a symptom of an underlying health concern. me/cfs is a common cause of chronic fatigue. people with chronic fatigue syndrome experience persistent fatigue lasting longer than six months that does not get better with rest.	good night's sleep can usually help you feel refreshed
should i take sleeping pills to help 'fix' my sleep?	tracking my own sleep and movement is incredibly helpful in informing my day's activities. for example, i use data from my wearable to determine if i should push a little harder during my daily workout, or if i need to take it easier. plus, i truly appreciate the reminder to start winding down for sleep. i wondered if my daughter's experience would be the same. my daughter is like a typical nine-year-old, but with more energy. she's bright and bubbly some days, crabby and moody others, i asked if she thought it'd be fun if we strapped a wearable to her wrist 24/7.	easier

how many hours should an elderly sleep?	although sleep needs vary among children, the national sleep foundation provides guidelines for how many hours babies and toddlers should sleep during each 24-hour period. if you are concerned that your baby sleeps too much or too little, contact your pediatrician. expert guidelines outline how much babies should sleep during both day and night. for this reason, how much a baby should nap largely depends on how much they sleep at night. babies should nap as many hours as needed to get sufficient sleep in a 24-hour period. for example, guidelines recommend that 6-month-olds should sleep 12 to 16 hours a day, so if they sleep eight hours at night, they should nap around four to eight hours during the day.	12 to 16 hours a day, so if they sleep eight
are sleep disorders genetic?	by contrast, central sleep apnea, a disorder that involves lapses in breathing due to brainstem signaling issues, appears to be largely caused by other, non-genetic factors. studies show that people face a greater risk of developing osa when they have a close family member with the disorder. experts estimate that about 40% of differences in the number of times people stop breathing (apnea hypopnea index or ahi) as they sleep is due to genetics. although researchers have been studying the genetics of sleep apnea for more than 20 years, relatively little is known about the specific genes involved with sleep-disordered breathing.	relatively little is known about the specific genes involved with sleep-disordered breathing
what are the consequences of sleep deprivation?	there are still many unanswered questions about what happens to your body when you lose rem sleep. for example, although many researchers believe that rem sleep is vital for memory consolidation, there do not appear to be any issues in making memories when a person loses rem sleep. scientists are not sure why medications and brain injuries that affect rem sleep fail to cause memory impairment. although scientists are still learning about consequences of rem sleep deprivation, it is clear that sleep deprivation in general can lead to a higher risk of weight gain, cardiovascular disease, and other health issues.	higher risk of weight gain, cardiovascular disease, and other health issues
how long should a nap last?	the ideal nap length for you depends on how much time you have to sleep, how soon you need to feel increased alertness after your nap, and how long you want that energy boost to last. a shorter nap is ideal when you need to immediately wake up and get back to work, while a longer nap might be a better idea if you are experiencing or about to experience sleep deprivation. a power nap is a brief nap intended to increase performance after waking. the optimal length of a power nap is still up for debate, though short naps are often defined as falling under 30 minutes.	how long
do i have any sleep disorder if i experience leg twitching?	so i do think that between technology and children, kids' weight, other medications that they're on for other disorders - and that may be fantastically appropriate for those conditions, but do carry with them some sort of sleep side effects - i think there's probably more sleep problems now than there have been in the past. and the problem is, as a medical doctor, i received a one hour lecture on sleep during the four years i was in medical school. and when you start looking at the most common complaints that people have when they go to see a doctor, one of them is fatigue and sleepiness, that's in the top seven.	there's probably more sleep problems now than there have been in the past
is it alright to take naps in the evening if i am really tired?	she agreed and even seemed excited. i hoped this at-home experiment would provide insight into what her day was going to look like. could we predict her next day according to her daily sleep scores, sleep graphs, and daily energy output? in our home, we have strict nighttime routines, complete with timepoints for activities like brushing teeth, ensuring we abide by bedtime. because i am hyper-aware of sleep routines, proper sleep hygiene, and what stages of my sleep cycle i should be in throughout the night and when, i wondered if i could apply the data gathered by a wearable to my daughter.	throughout the night
what is a conducive environment for sleeping?	the connections between smell and sleep are subject to continuing research, but knowing about what has been discovered so far provides opportunities to make your bedroom environment more conducive to quality sleep. your sense of smell is part of a complicated olfactory system. special cells in the nose, called olfactory neurons, receive chemical signals from all kinds of compounds in our environment. these neurons are directly connected to the brain, allowing for rapid identification of smells based on which neurons are stimulated. scents can reach neurons through the nostrils or from the back of the throat, which is part of why taste and smell are intricately connected.	bedroom
what are the effects of having 3 hours of sleep per night?	there are some differences between the sleeping patterns of a 3-month-old and a newborn, however. by 3 months, many babies sleep for somewhat longer periods at night and shorter periods during the day. on average, a three-month-old baby sleeps 7.4 hours at night, compared to a one-month-old baby, who averages 5.7 hours of sleep at night. three-month-olds are also more likely to wake up fewer times during the night than their younger counterparts. on average, three-month-olds wake up 2.78 times per night, which is less than one-month-olds, who wake up an average of 4.12 times per night.	more likely to wake up fewer times during the night than their younger counterparts
does sleep help with mental health	antipsychotics are drugs that are meant to help people who have mental health disorders in which they struggle to know what is and isn't real. it also used to treat bipolar disorder, which for many can present as cyclical insomnia. some antipsychotics have a sedative effect, but none have been approved by the fda or recommended by aasm for treating sleeping problems. they may be most useful when prescribed for patients who have co-occurring mental health conditions and insomnia. anticonvulsants are designed to stop or reduce seizures or other unwanted muscle activity. although they can have a sedative effect, no anticonvulsants are fda-approved for insomnia, and the aasm does not recommend their use.	none have been approved by the fda or recommended by aasm
what is considered sufficient sleep?	there is no standardized melatonin dosage chart by age or weight in the united states. additionally, there are no set guidelines for what time or how frequently children should take melatonin. consult your pediatrician to determine what dosage of melatonin and timing is right for your child. sleep is essential for children for a number of reasons. during sleep, the body releases growth hormones and repairs damaged tissue and muscle. appropriate sleep in children is linked to positive school performance. if your child is struggling to fall asleep or get sufficient sleep, talk to your healthcare provider.	if your child is struggling to fall asleep
how can i improve my diet to improve sleep quality?	using a wearable can help us pay attention and make small adjustments to daily practices, like sticking to a bedtime routine. these adjustments can enormously impact our moods, attitudes, and cognitive function. using a wearable has helped me gain insight into and improve my sleep routines. my experience prompted me to wonder, if sleep-tracking wearables help adults make positive lifestyle adjustments, would sleep tracking be beneficial for children, too? as the editor-in-chief of sleep foundation, i eat, breathe, and sleep sleep! for this reason, i felt excited to see how a sleep-tracking wearable might impact my nine-year-old daughter.	using a wearable
how does stress affect sleep?	generally, deep sleep is the first sleep stage to rebound, and rem rebound does not occur until a person is moderately to severely sleep deprived. while many of the factors that impact the length and quality of rem sleep are out of your control, there are things you can do to protect this sleep stage, such as making sure you get enough sleep and keeping your stress levels in check. alcohol, illicit drugs, and medications including certain antidepressants, antipsychotics, and sedatives can affect rem sleep. it is important to speak with your doctor if you have concerns about your current medications and how they may affect your sleep.	keeping your stress levels in check
what does it mean if i wake up frequently during the night to go to the toilet?	certainly all the research suggests, even with teenagers, that if you set them a bedtime they are more likely to get more sleep. so even when teenagers want to rule their own lives, giving them a bedtime is the way to go. sf: the stereotype of the teenager is one who stays up late and wakes up late; their circadian rhythm just shifts later, all-around. is that something we should be mindful of, or work to correct? or is that just what our bodies do when we're adolescents? dg: i think the western world does teenage students a disservice.	late
which strategies help to wake up easier?	in addition to other health benefits, daytime exercise has been linked to better sleep in patients with generalized anxiety disorders. exercise can also assist with issues such as insomnia. another strategy for sleep hygiene overall is to wake up at a regular time. even on the weekends, research shows that consistent wake times are an important component of sleep hygiene. keep in mind there is no exact schedule for how quickly you'll be able to feel less stressed and anxious before going to sleep. however, consistent practice of relaxing techniques can help long-term. if you have questions or concerns about which strategy or strategies are right for you, consult your physician.	relaxing techniques
what is the fastest way to fall asleep when i have insomnia?	different types of cbt have been developed for specific problems such as depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. in addition, cbt for insomnia (cbt-i) has a proven track record in reducing sleeping problems. a large clinical trial also showed that cbt-i could reduce symptoms of many mental health conditions, improving emotional well-being and decreasing psychotic episodes. whether and how types of cbt can be combined or sequenced to address both sleep and mental health problems is subject to ongoing research, but for many patients, help from a trained counselor to reframe their thinking can meaningfully improve both their sleep and mental state. a common cause of sleeping problems is poor sleep hygiene. stepping up sleep hygiene by cultivating habits and a bedroom setting that are conducive to sleep can go a long way in reducing sleep disruptions. finding the best routines and bedroom arrangement may take some trial and error to determine what's best for you, but that process can pay dividends in helping you fall asleep quickly and stay asleep through the night.	quickly and stay asleep through the night
are there recommended sleeping postures for a good night's rest?	a good night's sleep is essential to your overall health and wellbeing. experts recommend adults sleep seven to nine hours each night. proper sleep ensures you feel well-rested and have energy for the next day. a good night's rest also contributes to memory formation, helps grow and repair muscle and tissue, and prevents sickness. unfortunately, falling asleep or staying asleep can be difficult for certain types of sleepers. as many as 70% of americans report not sleeping the recommended hours, and nearly one-third of american workers sleep less than six hours per night. solutions for better sleep and avoiding sleep debt vary.	experts recommend adults sleep seven to nine hours each night
how can i feel less tired in the morning?	a regular exercise routine can positively impact your sleep. by physically tiring out your body, it may be easier to fall asleep at night. if you can, perform your exercise outside, early in the morning or day. the morning sunlight can also positively impact your sleep and mood, by affecting your circadian rhythm. medications may help relieve insomnia and related conditions by inhibiting arousal. some sleep aids can have serious side effects, so it is always important to consult your doctor before using one. cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (cbt-i) is considered the most effective treatment for insomnia.	physically tiring out your body
i drink a lot and find it difficult to stop myself especially when i am stressed out, alcohol helps me sleep better at night, i think this has become a habit, are there alternatives to help me fall asleep without alcohol?	this wearables experience changed me, maybe more than it changed my daughter. i found myself altering how i approached her right from the beginning of the day depending on how well she slept. if she didn't sleep well or i noticed a lot of nighttime disturbances in her graph, i would allow her more leeway. giving her the benefit of doubt seemed to ease the bumps we'd hit throughout our daytime hours together, and even allow us to have a quiet and calm drift into the evening. this insight into my daughter's nine-year-old brain made me realize something so simple: we're not that much different.	allow us to have a quiet and calm drift into the evening
why do i need to lie down on the bed in order to sleep?	even now there's a piece of research done recently that indicated it's regarded as masculine to be underslept. this is despite all the scientific evidence proving that a good night's sleep is vital to our short- and long-term health. people who sleep too much are looked down on. people who get the right amount of sleep, well why do you need that much? when i left university, i went into advertising, and i was highly stressed. i used alcohol to get to sleep, and then once i decided i didn't want to drink anymore, i couldn't get to sleep.	people who get the right amount of sleep

what are the benefits of taking naps?	research suggests 10 to 20 minutes is the ideal length for a power nap, although short naps lasting up to 30 minutes may provide benefits depending on what time of day you take the nap and how tired you were beforehand. the longer you nap, the more likely you are to enter slow wave sleep. waking from slow wave sleep can cause a groggy feeling known as sleep inertia. as a result, the benefits of a 10-minute nap are more likely to be felt immediately upon waking, while the benefits of a 20 or 30-minute nap might be delayed until sleep inertia wears off.	what time of day you take the nap and how tired you were beforehand
how to practice meditation?	mindfulness meditation is the act of intentionally moving your awareness to the present moment. with a long history in multiple religious traditions, mindfulness is now a mainstream practice popular worldwide. meditation practices can be silent or they can be coupled with movement or sound. meditation can be helpful for managing anxiety, stress, and difficulty sleeping. meditation likely promotes sleep by reducing pain sensitivity and stress, both of which can disturb sleep. the research around meditation and how it works to reduce anxiety, depression, and pain is ongoing. studies have found that the practice of meditation reduces pain-related activity in the thalamus, which is a small sensory structure in the brain.	can be silent or they can be coupled with movement or sound

how many hours should i sleep?	and i think the problem that we've got is, how do you cope with that body clock shift? you can't. you can't get a teenager to go to bed at 9:00. it's just not physically possible, because the melatonin isn't being secreted then. so then you look at the weekend. should you let them catch up on sleep? yes. how much? maximum two hours. does that mean they've got a sleep debt? yes, if they've knocked two hours off their recommended sleep each school night - which a lot of teenagers do - teenagers should be sleeping between eight to ten hours each night.	maximum two hours
why do i dream on some days but don't on others?	when a person experiences fatigue, they often feel tired but do not usually fall asleep when they want to be awake. excessive sleepiness is often referred to as excessive daytime sleepiness, or eds, by physicians and sleep specialists. to eliminate or reduce your eds, you must first figure out why you are experiencing it. if you experience excessive sleepiness, you've probably asked yourself, why am i so sleepy during the day? there is no single, universal answer to that question because different people experience excessive daytime sleepiness (eds) for various reasons. if you don't have health or psychiatric problems that could be causing your eds, consider exploring the possibility of a sleep disorder.	health or psychiatric problems
are there breverages i can drink to help me sleep better and longer? (e.g. warm milk)	scientific evidence suggests that warm milk before bed may help you sleep. in a study of people staying in a hospital's heart unit, those who drank warm milk and honey for three days noticed improvements in sleep. a study of adults over age 60 found that drinking fermented milk over the course of three weeks reduced nighttime wakings. if you struggle with initiating sleep, milk might be able to help. in a study of people over 65, those who drank more milk and engaged in physical activity reported falling asleep more easily than those who did not.	honey
what are habits i need to build to have a good sleep hygiene?	several steps can help avoid the dangers of drowsy driving. some tips are beneficial right before or during a trip, and others work to build lifestyle habits for healthy sleep. over the long-term, good sleep is the best protection against drowsy driving. focusing on sleep hygiene, which includes your habits and sleep setting, can enable better sleep every night. examples of sleep hygiene include maintaining a stable sleep schedule, limiting the use of electronic devices before bed, and making sure that your bedroom is quiet, dark, and conducive to uninterrupted rest. in addition to sleep hygiene improvements, you should talk with a doctor if you have persistent or severe problems with falling or staying asleep or if you regularly have daytime sleepiness. working with your doctor can identify the optimal approach to enhancing your sleep, which may involve testing to determine if you are affected by an underlying sleep disorder.	sleep setting
how can the effects of jet lag be reduced?	the following sections address methods of reorienting your circadian rhythm and practical tips for reducing jet lag. light is the most powerful influence on circadian rhythm, and strategic light exposure may help adjust your internal clock to avoid or reduce jet lag. the effect on circadian rhythm depends on the level and timing of light exposure. sunlight has the highest level of illumination and the strongest circadian effects. different types of artificial light can also influence circadian timing to a lesser degree. indiscriminate light exposure doesn't resolve jet lag because the timing is critical. at certain times, light exposure can either advance or delay your internal clock.	strategic light exposure
hard or soft mattress is better for sleep	if you aren't comfortable or don't feel supported by your bed, it's likely too soft or too firm. a mattress that's too hard doesn't cushion the sleeper at pressure points, causing discomfort and spinal misalignment. a mattress that's too soft can result in excessive sinkage and poor sleep posture. it's normal for brand-new beds to feel slightly off at first, so give it time. after allowing for an adjustment period, you should be able to tell relatively easily if the mattress is too soft or firm for you. while mattresses with a firm feel provide comfort and support to a range of sleepers, this firmness level doesn't work for everyone.	too soft or firm for you
how can exercise affect sleep?	exercise is essential to your overall health and wellbeing. even small amounts of physical activity can improve your mood and cognitive function, alleviate anxiety, and decrease your risk of diseases and other medical conditions. studies have also found that physical activity helps people sleep better. that said, how, how much, and when you exercise will affect your sleep in different ways. additionally, a good night's sleep is important for those who exercise regularly. sleep allows your body to recover from the previous day. getting enough rest after a workout strengthens your muscles and tissues, which can help you avoid fatigue and exercise-related injuries.	different ways
i sleepwalk all the time! what should i do?	sf: so it's about creating a positive association with sleep and the bedroom, as opposed to a negative one, and creating the bedroom as a place they should look forward to. i think the problem that we have these days is that we're all doing too much. we have a 24/7 lifestyle, often becoming over-attached to technology and especially mobile phones. now we've got the work/life balance and work-from-home problem. we are working later into the night, and having time to ourselves and time for our kids becomes hard. it's hard to juggle that. i encourage all the clients who i work with to really plan it out: look at when you're going to give the time to your children, look at how you're fitting your life around their needs, and that you're getting the things that you need to relax and switch off at night, too.	relax and switch off at night
what is a good habit to implement to improve my sleep quality?	for example, individuals with periodic limb movement disorder (plmd) experience involuntary jerking movements in their legs while they sleep, resulting in reduced sleep quality, and fatigue and poor concentration during the day. individuals with narcolepsy likewise often suffer from poor sleep quality, and experience daytime fatigue. fortunately, improving your sleep quality may be as simple as improving your sleep hygiene. just like dental hygiene involves regularly brushing and flossing to maintain your teeth, sleep hygiene is all about practicing good habits that help you get good sleep consistently. try these ideas to improve your sleep. if you still have trouble sleeping after implementing these suggestions, talk to your doctor. they may recommend other lifestyle changes, therapies, or medications that can improve your sleep quality.	sleep hygiene
how safe are melatonin supplements to consume before sleep?	both adults and older adults should try starting with the lowest possible amount of melatonin and slowly increasing as needed while being mindful of side effects. most experts recommend limiting melatonin to short-term use. there is not enough information available on the side effects of melatonin supplements to determine if pregnant or breastfeeding people can safely take these supplements. those who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant should avoid melatonin supplements unless directed by their physician. if you are struggling with sleep, ask your doctor for other ways to improve sleep during pregnancy. melatonin may be safe to use short-term for most children and adolescents, but you should always talk to your pediatrician before giving your child melatonin for the first time.	short-term for most children and adolescents
why should i sleep for at least 7 to 9 hours?	if they must wake up at 7 a.m. to be at school on time, they would need to fall asleep by 9 p.m. a 5-year-old with greater sleep needs would need to fall asleep earlier, such as by 7 p.m. in order to sleep for 12 hours. one study involving 8-year-olds found that, on average, children took 19 minutes to fall asleep. the researchers also acknowledged that it was common for children to take up to 32 minutes to fall asleep. to account for this sleep latency time, lights out should occur about half an hour before the parent wants the child to be asleep.	greater sleep needs

what is the best environment to sleep	a noisy environment can disrupt sleep and increase the risk of long-term health effects. the world health organization recommends keeping environmental noise levels below 40 decibels at night. unfortunately, depending on where you live, it may be impossible to ensure a sufficiently quiet bedroom environment. there is growing interest in using sounds such as music and white noise to reduce the effects of environmental noise. using sound to improve sleep is an easy, low-cost method with few known side effects. research so far demonstrates that certain sounds may help people relax for sleep and improve sleep quality, so it's worth examining how to do so, as well as what sounds work best for sleep.	using sound to improve sleep
what is the latest time for the consumption of caffeine?	a large cup of coffee can have up to 470 mg of caffeine content which is more than the daily recommended caffeine content. it is essential to read the fine print about what you're drinking. since there can be a lot of variation in the way people respond to and metabolize caffeine, talk to your doctor if you are unsure if your caffeine consumption is recommended. the recommended cut-off time for caffeine use is a minimum of six hours before bedtime. for example, if you typically go to bed at 10pm, avoiding caffeine after 4pm can help minimize sleep problems.	six hours before bedtime
how can i track my progress when it comes to developing better sleep habits?	using a wearable can help us pay attention and make small adjustments to daily practices, like sticking to a bedtime routine. these adjustments can enormously impact our moods, attitudes, and cognitive function. using a wearable has helped me gain insight into and improve my sleep routines. my experience prompted me to wonder, if sleep-tracking wearables help adults make positive lifestyle adjustments, would sleep tracking be beneficial for children, too? as the editor-in-chief of sleep foundation, i eat, breathe, and sleep sleep! for this reason, i felt excited to see how a sleep-tracking wearable might impact my nine-year-old daughter.	using a wearable
will listening to white noise help improve my quality of sleep?	other recent studies have continued to find white noise positively affecting sleep. for example, people living in a high-noise area of new york city fell asleep faster and spent more of their time in bed asleep while listening to white noise. in another study, listening to white noise through headphones improved sleep quality for critically ill patients in a loud hospital unit in india. more research is needed to confirm whether an inherent characteristic of white noise improves sleep - perhaps by synchronizing brain waves - or if the sound primarily helps by masking background noise. disruptive noise during sleep can cause changes in heart rate that suggest the sleeper is experiencing semi-awakenings.	improved sleep quality
how long is appropriate for a nap?	people nap for a variety of reasons. perhaps taking an afternoon siesta is part of your culture, or maybe you have noticed a midday nap helps you feel less stressed. however, busy work schedules do not always allow for long daytime breaks to retreat to bed. this is why many people are intrigued by the idea of the power nap. we explore this short nap, specifically designed for workers, and delve into how long a power nap should be, the benefits it provides, how it compares to drinking coffee for alertness, and tips for a better power nap.	how long
how can i recover from pulling an all-nighter?	these situations involve grave potential consequences from daytime sleepiness, microsleeps, impaired attention, decreased response time, and slowed thinking that can result from pulling an all-nighter. even if you know you shouldn't pull an all-nighter, you might wind up in a situation where there doesn't seem to be another option. these tips can help you stay awake when pulling an all-nighter. once you've made it through, the next challenge is to take the right steps to recover from an all-nighter. if you've survived an all-nighter and effectively recovered, it's time to look forward and think about how to prevent finding yourself in the same situation.	if you've survived an all-nighter and effectively recovered

does wearing blue light filter glasses when doing work allow me to sleep better at night?	avoiding technology which emits blue light is key, particularly for teenagers. blue light stops the production of melatonin, which is the hormone that produces our desire to sleep. teenagers are more sensitive to the blue light that technology screens emit. so always look at putting dimmers on the blue light technology and wearing glasses that filter out blue light to get that blue light out of your system, ideally an hour before bedtime. look at some form of mindfulness or meditation to help children to relax and switch off. there's lots of research now showing that mindfulness, meditation, or yoga nidra all create a brainwave that's very similar to the deep sleep brainwave, so they get you into that stage quicker.	ideally an hour before bedtime
how many stages of sleep are there	other parasomnias that happen most often during stage 3 sleep include sleep talking and night terrors. it is normal to wake up briefly several times during sleep and sleepers are usually unaware of these short arousals. however, too many disruptions can affect sleep quality and cause a sleeper to wake up feeling unrefreshed. sleep disruptions can also affect a person's sleep stages. whether from missing sleep or waking up too often during the night, the body makes up for lost sleep by spending more time in deep nrem sleep. after longer periods of sleep loss, a person may also experience an increase in rem sleep. sleep deprivation is only one of many factors that can alter how the body transitions through sleep stages. diet: certain food and drinks, including those that contain caffeine and alcohol, can reduce the time a sleeper spends in stage 3 sleep. while alcohol also reduces rem sleep early in the night, the body compensates with more rem sleep as the night goes on and the effects of alcohol wear off.	3
how can sleep affect my stress?	stress is an important part of human biology that allows people to react quickly and decisively in the face of challenging or dangerous situations. however, too much stress can have a profound impact on sleep and overall health. surveys suggest the stress of the covid-19 pandemic has taken a significant toll on sleep quality, with one study finding that 41% of people experienced negative changes to their sleep quality in large part due to covid-related stress. we examine how stress levels can affect sleep quality and how poor sleep in turn can affect stress levels. we also provide actionable advice on how to manage stress and improve sleep habits.	poor sleep in turn can affect stress levels

am i able to sleep short hours?	thus, a natural night owl may be able to wake up at 7 am every day for work, but they may not be productive until later in the day. conversely, an early bird may wake up bright and chipper for their 7 am shift, but then start to feel sleepy already in the late afternoon. chronotype does not influence total sleep time. if most adults need between seven and nine hours of sleep a night, this is usually much easier to accomplish for an early bird than for a night owl, who has trouble falling asleep before 1 am.	if most adults need between seven and nine hours of sleep a night
what kind of exercise is good for sleep?	if you stick to healthy, nutrient-rich foods, you'll find it easier to stick to your intermittent fasting schedule. opt for whole foods, fruits, vegetables, and healthy proteins and fats. as a bonus, the foods that are good for your diet are good for your sleep, too. as with any change in routine, it takes a few days to adjust to intermittent fasting. allow yourself some flexibility as you figure out a schedule that works for you. fasting for eight hours might be easier than 12, or you may prefer to lower your caloric intake a few days of the week. be kind to yourself and do what works for you. by eating on a regular schedule, you may find yourself sleeping on a regular schedule more easily. consult your doctor before beginning an intermittent fasting practice, especially if you are pregnant or have a health condition.	foods that are good for your diet
how to lower a temperature in the room for the night without turning on an ac?	also, with longer days, consider transitioning inside, out of daylight, in the hour before bed. this will cue your body that it's time to prepare for sleep. turning on a fan or the ac could also help create ideal summer sleep conditions for your kids and teens. when the temperature is too hot, people tend to experience more sleep disruptions. if you're worried about making the room too cold, make sure your kids have bedding they can use or remove to regulate body temperature during the night. if you have a family vacation planned, or if you're sending the kids off to summer camp, take efforts to make sure travel doesn't negatively impact sleep.	make sure your kids have bedding
what examples of candle scents are good to get a good quality of sleep?	music without lyrics is the best choice for sleep. scent is an often-overlooked part of the bedroom environment. research suggests that some essential oils - specifically lavender, heliotrope, sandalwood, cedarwood, cypress, and juniper - may encourage relaxation and make it easier to fall or stay asleep. since these effects appear to be caused by organic compounds in the essential oils, artificial scents are unlikely to have the same effect. some fragrances can also cause headaches and other side effects that are not conducive to sleep. scented candles can be a fire hazard, so it's better to use an essential oil diffuser or room spray if you want to harness the power of scent in your bedroom.	essential oil diffuser or room spray
can i switch from coffee to sodas to keep myself awake when studying?	this wearables experience changed me, maybe more than it changed my daughter. i found myself altering how i approached her right from the beginning of the day depending on how well she slept. if she didn't sleep well or i noticed a lot of nighttime disturbances in her graph, i would allow her more leeway. giving her the benefit of doubt seemed to ease the bumps we'd hit throughout our daytime hours together, and even allow us to have a quiet and calm drift into the evening. this insight into my daughter's nine-year-old brain made me realize something so simple: we're not that much different.	i would allow her more leeway
is important to have a regular bedtime?	some studies have found that eating too close to bedtime can lead to weight gain, though a more important factor seems to be the type of food you eat. if you feel compelled to indulge in a midnight snack, stay away from junk food, and opt for a light and healthy snack instead. as a bonus, a healthier diet, in turn, improves sleep quality. regular exercise and a healthy diet can help you regularize your sleep schedule, improve your muscle-to-fat ratio, and boost your metabolism. avoid drinking caffeine and alcohol before bed. while caffeine does cause a temporary spike in metabolism, it interferes with sleep and is not an effective weight-loss strategy.	regular exercise and a healthy diet can help you regularize your sleep schedule
should i study or sleep	a study of children with chiari i malformation found that the farther the brain protrudes downward into the spinal canal, the more likely a person is to have osa. researchers have also connected factors such as syrinxes, fluid in the brain, and displacement of cerebrospinal fluid to sleep-disordered breathing in people with chiari malformations. some researchers hypothesize that chiari i malformation might become symptomatic during childhood in more people than originally thought, especially in children younger than 3 years old. experts urge doctors to incorporate testing for sleep-disordered breathing when treating people for chiari malformations. likewise, doctors should consider the possibility that a child might have an undiagnosed chiari malformation if they are experiencing sleep apnea for seemingly no reason.	sleep apnea for seemingly no reason
how many hours of sleep should i get?	and i think the problem that we've got is, how do you cope with that body clock shift? you can't. you can't get a teenager to go to bed at 9:00. it's just not physically possible, because the melatonin isn't being secreted then. so then you look at the weekend. should you let them catch up on sleep? yes. how much? maximum two hours. does that mean they've got a sleep debt? yes, if they've knocked two hours off their recommended sleep each school night - which a lot of teenagers do - teenagers should be sleeping between eight to ten hours each night.	maximum two hours
is it possible to fall asleep while standing?	the fading method, also known as camping out, encourages parents to stay in their child's room until they fall asleep. parents can do this by standing, or by sitting in a chair in their child's room, a variation known as the chair method. with this method, parents take their child through a bedtime routine and put them in bed while the child is still drowsy. then, the parents stay by their side until they fall asleep. each night, the parent gradually moves further away from their child while still remaining in their sight. for example, they may start right next to their crib, then a few feet away, then by a dresser in the room, and then by the door.	parents can do this by standing
can you share with me about the sleep cycle?	we may lose sleep, and with that, our resilience to cope with stress. but, by making sleep a health priority, the home dynamic can change - as can the cycle of stress. sleep foundation asked dr. wendy troxel, clinical psychologist, sleep researcher, and author of sharing the covers: every couple's guide to better sleep, about the toll this stress is taking on all of us - and what we can do about it. troxel shared techniques we can try tonight that can help strengthen our relationships with others and our sleep. while moderate amounts of short-term stress may pose a relatively low risk to our health, chronic stress can have a major impact on our bodies and cause insomnia, among other health issues.	sharing the covers
does light affect sleep	as a result, exposure to artificial light outside of daytime hours can disrupt our circadian rhythm and, in turn, our sleep drive. how does our body clock know what time of day it is? the circadian biological clock is controlled by a part of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (scn), a group of cells in the hypothalamus that respond to light and dark signals. when our eyes perceive light, our retinas send a signal to our scn. the scn sets off a chain reaction of hormone production and suppression that affects body temperature, appetite, sleep drive, and more.	exposure to artificial light outside of daytime hours can disrupt our circadian rhythm
how can i make myself fall asleep faster?	this wearables experience changed me, maybe more than it changed my daughter. i found myself altering how i approached her right from the beginning of the day depending on how well she slept. if she didn't sleep well or i noticed a lot of nighttime disturbances in her graph, i would allow her more leeway. giving her the benefit of doubt seemed to ease the bumps we'd hit throughout our daytime hours together, and even allow us to have a quiet and calm drift into the evening. this insight into my daughter's nine-year-old brain made me realize something so simple: we're not that much different.	i would allow her more leeway
does diet affect sleep	a central role of nutrition is having a high enough intake of a broad range of vitamins and minerals that enable almost all types of bodily systems and processes. growing evidence indicates that sufficient nutrient consumption is important for sleep. one large study found a lack of key nutrients, such as calcium, magnesium, and vitamins a, c, d, e, and k to be associated with sleep problems. while this research does not prove cause-and-effect, it supports the likelihood that diet affects hormonal pathways involved in sleep. high-carbohydrate meals with high glycemic indexes can also affect one's energy level and sleep quality.	diet affects hormonal pathways involved in sleep
are naps beneficial?	power naps can boost energy and are a beneficial nap length if they last between 15 and 30 minutes. prophylactic napping can be an effective practice for people who work long shifts, night shifts, and others who anticipate a period of sleep deprivation. prophylactic napping involves taking a nap prior to a night of sleep loss in order to reduce fatigue while awake. taking a 10 minute nap during a night shift has been shown to help maintain performance while minimizing sleep inertia. some people rely on restorative or replacement napping to make up for sleep loss due to poor sleep.	are a beneficial nap length if they last between 15 and 30 minutes
what should i do if i'm physically tired, but mentally active?	when i'm not rested, i'm grumpy, crabby, and generally unpleasant. and, like her mom, my little girl is, too - but i had lost sight of that before a wearable helped me remember. although we received a lot of new information from the wearable, we did not change much in my daughter's schedule - no cancelled weekend movie nights in favor of sleep on the weekends, for sure. she needs to be a kid and have those cheating-the-system moments! what this experiment really helped me understand, however, is how significantly sleep impacts her every day. it also taught me how to approach her during an off-day.	grumpy, crabby, and generally unpleasant
what kind of candle scents are good to get a good quality of sleep?	music without lyrics is the best choice for sleep. scent is an often-overlooked part of the bedroom environment. research suggests that some essential oils - specifically lavender, heliotrope, sandalwood, cedarwood, cypress, and juniper - may encourage relaxation and make it easier to fall or stay asleep. since these effects appear to be caused by organic compounds in the essential oils, artificial scents are unlikely to have the same effect. some fragrances can also cause headaches and other side effects that are not conducive to sleep. scented candles can be a fire hazard, so it's better to use an essential oil diffuser or room spray if you want to harness the power of scent in your bedroom.	scented
my sister sometimes shouts in her sleep, but she doesn't wake up. is this a sign of night restlessness?	as i mentioned, my daughter is active - she enjoys running, jumping, bicycle riding, etc. still, the lower her sleep score, the less likely she was to show her typical signs of wanting to get outside and play. even when i pushed her to participate in physically activity, she immediately declined or bailed on the activity halfway through if she had a lower sleep score the night before. when my daughter's sleep score hit 90 or more, she was exuberant the next day. after sleeping well, she easily engaged both in school and out, and had a far simpler time letting not-so-great aspects of her day roll off her back, like a math test that went sideways.	she immediately declined or bailed on the activity halfway through
is it okay to consume a lot of caffeine if i'm not sensitive to caffeine?	different people have different sensitivity levels to caffeine, so if you notice that caffeine is negatively impacting you, it may help to reduce the amount you consume. be mindful of what you eat with your morning coffee and any sugar or sweetener you add to it. in many parts of the world, drinks like coffee have become hidden sources of added sugar in a person's diet. for people with diabetes, consuming sugar can prompt fatigue. additionally, caffeine consumption can negatively impact the body's ability to properly manage sugar, potentially increasing any resulting fatigue. to combat the potential dehydration that often accompanies higher doses of caffeine, be sure to drink plenty of water. this is especially relevant if you do not regularly consume coffee, as you may be more sensitive to its diuretic effects.	this is especially relevant if you do not regularly consume coffee
how does sleep affect my mood?	together, we decided on the amazon halo. the halo is a relatively inexpensive fitness wearable that does not have a screen (score!) but tracks sleep. the halo comes in three default band colors: black, silver, and light pink. there are also a variety of both fabric and silicone replacement bands available in many different colors. we settled on the color unicorn, a soft fabric band with light aqua and pink. next, we downloaded the amazon halo app to my phone, and we were off! my expectation was that if my daughter's sleep scores were in the 90s - demonstrating that she cycled through four stages of sleep with optimal time spent in each - her mood, energy, and outlook for the day would be positive.	optimal time spent in each
how does exercising helps improve sleep	numerous studies have shown that, generally, exercise improves sleep. but, exercise may impact the body differently depending on the time of day a person exercises. we look at the benefits and drawbacks of working out before bed and discuss the best time to exercise for a good night's sleep. when giving sleep hygiene advice, experts often warn that late afternoon and evening exercise can disrupt sleep. some sleep researchers speculate that, as a result, many individuals who are unable to exercise earlier in the day may skip workouts altogether. however, a growing body of evidence suggests that working out before bed does not make it harder for most adults to fall asleep and may even help some get better rest.	exercise improves sleep
if i sleep less during the week, can i compensate the sleeping duration by sleeping for much more than eight hours during weekend?	instead, recent research suggests that long sleepers spend more time in bed and more time asleep than normal duration sleepers. however, some natural long sleepers may not be able to sleep as much as they would like because of school, work, or social obligations. as a result, they may sleep less on weeknights but have especially long sleep periods, such as 12 hours or more, during the weekend when their time to sleep is not restricted. excessive daytime sleepiness is another potential symptom of being a long sleeper. if long sleepers do not have enough time in their schedule to sleep as much as they prefer, they may feel sleepy or less alert during the day and experience issues with energy or attention.	12 hours
does sleeping late/waking late or sleeping early/waking early have a difference, if i have the same duration of sleep?	some people are naturally early risers. others prefer to stay up late and sleep in later in the morning. however, standard work and school schedules are not always accommodating for late risers. if you are aiming to change your sleep habits so you can wake up earlier in the morning, first evaluate what you find most difficult about waking up early. then, it may help to take a look at your current sleep habits and build new habits that help you get a better night's sleep. you may have difficulty waking up in the morning for a number of reasons.	late
how does one have uninterrupted sleep?	not only does healthy sleep requires successfully sleeping for a certain number of hours, it also means getting quality, uninterrupted sleep over the course of those hours and doing so with consistency. sleep is a complex process that affects our entire body. when we sleep, we cycle through a series of sleep stages, from light sleep (stages 1 and 2) to deep sleep (stage 3) and then rapid eye movement (rem) sleep. successfully cycling through all of these sleep stages multiple times each night allows sleep to perform its critical function of restoring our bodies and minds. you will reap the greatest benefits from sleep when you get enough hours of sleep each night, have sleep that is relatively uninterrupted, and maintain a consistent sleep schedule suiting your natural circadian rhythms.	consistency
what time should i exercise during the day in order to improve my sleep duration and quality?	tracking my own sleep and movement is incredibly helpful in informing my day's activities. for example, i use data from my wearable to determine if i should push a little harder during my daily workout, or if i need to take it easier. plus, i truly appreciate the reminder to start winding down for sleep. i wondered if my daughter's experience would be the same. my daughter is like a typical nine-year-old, but with more energy. she's bright and bubbly some days, crabby and moody others, i asked if she thought it'd be fun if we strapped a wearable to her wrist 24/7.	a little harder
what are all the stages in our sleep cycle?	sleep spindles also appear to diminish our response to outside stimuli while sleeping. sleep spindles generally only occur during certain stages of sleep. generally, sleepers cycle through four stages of sleep each night. these four stages are broken up into two categories: rapid eye movement (rem) and non-rapid eye movement (nrem). sleep stages 1, 2, and 3 are categorized as nrem sleep, and stage 4 is rem sleep. we spend approximately 75% to 80% of our total sleep time in nrem sleep, which involves a slowing of brain activity, breathing, and heart rate. during rem sleep, our limbs stay paralyzed, but our brain activity, breathing, heart rate, and eye movements are more similar to what occurs when we are awake.	rapid eye movement (rem) and non-rapid eye movement
does the kinds of food affect sleep quality	it has been well established that high-carbohydrate meals often can make you feel drowsy. high-carbohydrate meals can also impair your sleep quality. in fact, high carbohydrate intake has been shown to increase the number of awakenings at night and reduce the amount of deep sleep you get. it is not a surprise that frequent consumption of energy drinks and sugar-sweetened beverages is associated with poor sleep quality. many different types of diets can offer this kind of nutritional balance, and some have been evaluated more closely for how they affect sleep. for example, the mediterranean diet, which is plant-based while incorporating lean meats and high-fiber foods, has been found to improve heart health and sleep quality.	high-carbohydrate meals can also impair your sleep quality
what fruits to eat before going to sleep to have a good sleep?	urinary incontinence is an experience common to pregnancy and menopause, and increases with age. prevent your bladder from waking you up at night by limiting what you drink before bed, and using the restroom one last time before going to sleep. late-night eating can cause indigestion and discomfort that leads to poor sleep quality. pregnancy also increases your risk for acid reflux, and spicy foods can trigger a hot flash that may interrupt sleep. schedule your last big meal for at least three hours before bed. if you get hungry after that, try a light snack of yogurt, nuts, milk, or fruit.	yogurt, nuts, milk, or fruit
why am i not able to sleep on a hot day?	when a person experiences fatigue, they often feel tired but do not usually fall asleep when they want to be awake. excessive sleepiness is often referred to as excessive daytime sleepiness, or eds, by physicians and sleep specialists. to eliminate or reduce your eds, you must first figure out why you are experiencing it. if you experience excessive sleepiness, you've probably asked yourself, why am i so sleepy during the day? there is no single, universal answer to that question because different people experience excessive daytime sleepiness (eds) for various reasons. if you don't have health or psychiatric problems that could be causing your eds, consider exploring the possibility of a sleep disorder.	different people experience excessive daytime sleepiness (eds) for various reasons
does eating and drinking sugary stuff before sleep affect my sleep?	a few studies have also found a strong link between sugary drinks and poor sleep, although sugary drinks often contain caffeine, which can impact sleep quality on its own. since most studies on diet and sleep have been observational, researchers have been unable to definitively pinpoint whether poor sleep leads to cravings for sugary foods, or whether sugary foods affect sleep. sleep deprivation alters the brain's reward system, making people more likely to indulge in foods that are high in sugar and fat. people who don't receive sufficient amounts of sleep are also more likely to consume more calories overall, eat the bulk of their food later in the day, and favor snacks over proper meals.	sleep deprivation alters the brain's reward system
what are the effects of sleep deprivation	we explore what it means to be a long sleeper, as well as potential causes and effects of long sleeping. long sleepers are people who regularly sleep more than other people of the same age. in adults, this typically means sleeping for more than 9 or 10 hours per night. most long sleepers feel refreshed when they wake up from this extended sleep time. however, if their professional or social life prevents them from having long sleep periods, they may experience excessive daytime sleepiness. long sleeping does not have a clear cause. in this way, it is different from oversleeping that occurs because of an illness or after a temporary period of sleep deprivation.	oversleeping
how do i know if i am sleep deprived?	she agreed and even seemed excited. i hoped this at-home experiment would provide insight into what her day was going to look like. could we predict her next day according to her daily sleep scores, sleep graphs, and daily energy output? in our home, we have strict nighttime routines, complete with timepoints for activities like brushing teeth, ensuring we abide by bedtime. because i am hyper-aware of sleep routines, proper sleep hygiene, and what stages of my sleep cycle i should be in throughout the night and when, i wondered if i could apply the data gathered by a wearable to my daughter.	apply the data gathered by a wearable to my daughter
how many hours of sleep does a child need?	ensuring infants go to sleep and stay asleep can be a challenge parents face. many look forward to the time when their child will sleep through the night-but when exactly will that happen? most babies sleep through the night around 6 months. in one study, about 38% of 6-month-olds were not sleeping through the night, but that number dropped to less than 28% by 12 months. this is reflective of how the sleep cycles for babies change as they grow. newborns ages 0-3 months need 14-17 hours of sleep, and infants ages 4-11 months need between 12 and 15 hours.	14-17 hours
do i need more hours of sleep to recover from an intensive workout?	most exercises are considered moderate- or high-intensity. when you engage in high-intensity - also known as vigorous-intensity - exercises, you will need to pause for a breath after speaking only a few words. examples of high-intensity exercise include running or jogging, lap-swimming, cycling at least 10 miles, or uphill hiking. high-intensity exercise prior to bedtime has been shown to increase heart rate and delay sleep onset, making it harder to fall asleep. in one study, a group of physically fit men performed either a moderate- or high-intensity workout before going to bed. those who engaged in the latter had a higher heart rate and took 14 more minutes to fall asleep compared to those who performed a moderate-intensity workout.	making it harder to fall asleep
how often should i work out	sf: so it's about creating a positive association with sleep and the bedroom, as opposed to a negative one, and creating the bedroom as a place they should look forward to. i think the problem that we have these days is that we're all doing too much. we have a 24/7 lifestyle, often becoming over-attached to technology and especially mobile phones. now we've got the work/life balance and work-from-home problem. we are working later into the night, and having time to ourselves and time for our kids becomes hard. it's hard to juggle that. i encourage all the clients who i work with to really plan it out: look at when you're going to give the time to your children, look at how you're fitting your life around their needs, and that you're getting the things that you need to relax and switch off at night, too.	we are working later into the night
will switching from coffee to matcha help me with my caffeine addiction?	coffee and many types of tea contain caffeine. caffeine is generally safe in moderate quantities but can be harmful in excess or when consumed late in the day. drinking coffee in the afternoon or evening can also negatively impact sleep. caffeine sensitivity varies from person to person. in general, it's best to avoid caffeine for at least six hours before your planned bedtime to prevent sleep problems. earlier in the day, caffeine may provide a useful pick-me-up to counteract daytime sleepiness related to jet lag or travel fatigue; however, it's important not to rely on caffeine at the expense of sufficient nightly sleep.	important not to rely on caffeine at the expense of sufficient nightly sleep
does taking naps affect my sleep at night?	to encourage sleep, it is recommended parents build a regular bedtime routine for their children. a nighttime routine can include a snack, hygiene such as brushing teeth or taking a bath, and reading or singing lullabies. occasional naps may still happen after children no longer have scheduled naptime. growth spurts, changes in routine, and school may affect your child's sleepiness. the return to naps is usually not a problem so long as the nap time is structured and does not affect the child's nighttime sleep. keep in mind that as your child grows older, quiet time is still an important element of children's lives. also, be aware that napping in adolescents has been shown to be related to a decrease in nighttime sleep and sleep overall. be sure to consult your pediatrician if you have concerns about your child's sleep habits, or if there are any serious, sudden changes in your child sleeping too much or not enough.	does not affect the child's nighttime sleep
what can i do to improve my insomnia?	while our family chose the amazon halo for our experiment, there are numerous sleep trackers available that are appropriate for kids, such as the garmin vivofit jr. 2 and fitbit ace 2 and 3. the data these trackers provide can offer a new perspective on your child's daily and nightly routines and sleep quality. do i vote for every child being constantly analyzed for data? certainly not. you have to do what makes you and your family comfortable. wearables can be a gentle, fun, non-invasive way of gaining insight into your child's inner workings. and, hey, now my daughter wakes up every morning and asks, can i check my sleep score?. how much sleep do babies and kids need? do your children get enough sleep? is your child getting enough sleep? here's how to tell.	check my sleep score
how can my home environment influence my sleeping habits?	the conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and concision. sleep foundation (sf): thanks for your time today! i'd like to begin by discussing your background. how did you initially become interested in this field of sleep? dave gibson (dg): i had a childhood where sleep wasn't really mentioned. i had two parents - one who didn't sleep, my mother, and one who slept every time he could, which was my dad. i have my mom's sleep genes, so i have to work hard at getting to sleep. so when i look back to my history, i had poor sleep.	i have my mom's sleep genes
sometimes i wake up in the middle of the night but i can't move my body at all. is that a sign that i need more sleep or less?	it's out in the open your hamstring hurts, let's talk about it so we can figure out we need to do something. but we don't sometimes talk about sleep in meaningful ways. so my hope is this book creates a conversation about it, because i don't think we can talk about it too much. and so when you're out with your friends, and you're talking about, my kid does this in his sleep and i read something about that one time, my hope is that this gets people talking, and moving in directions of finding that solution.	we don't sometimes talk about sleep in meaningful ways
how long should one sleep per day?	generally speaking, kids should stop napping when they no longer need a nap to feel energized for a full day. many children will stop napping naturally. infants until one year of age will take naps 1-4 times per day. as the brain matures, fewer and fewer naps are required. by 18-24 months, children need only one nap each day. children who take early afternoon naps for a set duration of fewer than 60 minutes have been observed sleeping well at night. however, naps should not be shortened if the child is sleeping well at bedtime.	by 18-24 months
how to sleep with body ache	during sleep, your body works to restore and repair itself. your sleep position can either help or hinder that process, depending on how effectively it supports the natural curvature of your spine. it's also common for people to wake up with brand new aches and pains in the morning, sometimes due to sleep position. we spend a third of our lives asleep or resting, so it's important to choose a sleep position that assists your body with physical recovery. a proper sleep position can relieve stress on your spine, while an unhealthy position can increase pain or stiffness in the back, arms, or shoulders, all while contributing to lower-quality sleep.	brand new aches and pains in the morning
why do i get headaches after sleeping	even now there's a piece of research done recently that indicated it's regarded as masculine to be underslept. this is despite all the scientific evidence proving that a good night's sleep is vital to our short- and long-term health. people who sleep too much are looked down on. people who get the right amount of sleep, well why do you need that much? when i left university, i went into advertising, and i was highly stressed. i used alcohol to get to sleep, and then once i decided i didn't want to drink anymore, i couldn't get to sleep.	i couldn't get to sleep
does my sleeping position affect my quality of sleep?	together, we decided on the amazon halo. the halo is a relatively inexpensive fitness wearable that does not have a screen (score!) but tracks sleep. the halo comes in three default band colors: black, silver, and light pink. there are also a variety of both fabric and silicone replacement bands available in many different colors. we settled on the color unicorn, a soft fabric band with light aqua and pink. next, we downloaded the amazon halo app to my phone, and we were off! my expectation was that if my daughter's sleep scores were in the 90s - demonstrating that she cycled through four stages of sleep with optimal time spent in each - her mood, energy, and outlook for the day would be positive.	her mood, energy, and outlook for the day would be positive
my sleep issues are not related to poor sleeping habits, where can i get help?	the conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and concision. sleep foundation (sf): thanks for your time today! i'd like to begin by discussing your background. how did you initially become interested in this field of sleep? dave gibson (dg): i had a childhood where sleep wasn't really mentioned. i had two parents - one who didn't sleep, my mother, and one who slept every time he could, which was my dad. i have my mom's sleep genes, so i have to work hard at getting to sleep. so when i look back to my history, i had poor sleep.	my mom's sleep genes
how do you measure sleep duration?	since sleep latency is related to tiredness, the measure is also influenced by sleep debt. sleep debt refers to how much sleep you have missed. for example, if you require eight hours of sleep at night but you only receive six hours, your sleep debt is two hours. sleep debt accumulates across multiple nights, and it can negatively impact a person's physical health and cognitive ability. people are not always aware of the cognitive problems caused by their sleep debt, nor do they always feel sleepy while experiencing sleep debt. measuring sleep latency can help identify when sleep debt is at play.	eight hours
i prefer to stay up in the night to study, how can i balance studying and sleeping?	i was never told that sleep was important, was never encouraged to do it, and i was never educated on it. in fact, if i had behaved properly and if i'd have done well at school, i could stay up late at night to watch the midweek sport, so i was getting rewarded for losing sleep. and by the time i got to my teenage years, i was allowed to play in a band midweek until midnight. my dad was a former semi-pro musician, so i was encouraged to follow that, and i'd be the kid at the back of the class falling asleep.	i could stay up late at night to watch the midweek sport
should i sleep more closer to the exam period when i have to revise for my papers?	tracking my own sleep and movement is incredibly helpful in informing my day's activities. for example, i use data from my wearable to determine if i should push a little harder during my daily workout, or if i need to take it easier. plus, i truly appreciate the reminder to start winding down for sleep. i wondered if my daughter's experience would be the same. my daughter is like a typical nine-year-old, but with more energy. she's bright and bubbly some days, crabby and moody others, i asked if she thought it'd be fun if we strapped a wearable to her wrist 24/7.	i truly appreciate the reminder to start winding down for sleep
if i don't drink coffee throughout the whole day, i feel tired, and sometimes i drink up to eight cups. how much should i cut down to help me sleep better?	this wearables experience changed me, maybe more than it changed my daughter. i found myself altering how i approached her right from the beginning of the day depending on how well she slept. if she didn't sleep well or i noticed a lot of nighttime disturbances in her graph, i would allow her more leeway. giving her the benefit of doubt seemed to ease the bumps we'd hit throughout our daytime hours together, and even allow us to have a quiet and calm drift into the evening. this insight into my daughter's nine-year-old brain made me realize something so simple: we're not that much different.	i would allow her more leeway
is it okay to drink coffee before bed	although coffee increases alertness, it has limited effects for higher cognitive processes, and it cannot mask underlying sleepiness forever. if you are feeling tired despite drinking coffee, you might be sleep-deprived. consider sleeping for longer, or examining your sleep quality to see if you might be experiencing unrefreshing sleep despite spending a long time in bed. studies show that drinking coffee within the six hours before bed can disrupt sleep, so consider limiting coffee to the morning and favoring sleep-promoting foods at night. food & drug administration recommends consuming no more than 400 milligrams of caffeine per day - the amount found in about four cups of coffee.	studies show that drinking coffee within the six hours before bed can disrupt sleep
what colour of light is good for good quality of sleep?	but what does the amount of daylight we get have to do with our sleep? can't we just turn on a lamp and get the light we need? our body clock has evolved and developed to follow signals from the sun clock, organizing processes in the body according to circadian rhythms. even on a cloudy day, natural light is many times stronger than artificial light, so it is a crucial driver of our body clock. exposure to daylight helps keep the rhythms of our body clock in sync with our environment. this is crucial for good sleep and good health, as these rhythms can control our cells, muscles, and organs, says sonia ancoli-israel, a university of california san diego psychiatry and research professor.	natural light
am i really sleeping when i dream?	she agreed and even seemed excited. i hoped this at-home experiment would provide insight into what her day was going to look like. could we predict her next day according to her daily sleep scores, sleep graphs, and daily energy output? in our home, we have strict nighttime routines, complete with timepoints for activities like brushing teeth, ensuring we abide by bedtime. because i am hyper-aware of sleep routines, proper sleep hygiene, and what stages of my sleep cycle i should be in throughout the night and when, i wondered if i could apply the data gathered by a wearable to my daughter.	i am hyper-aware
instead of having 8 hours sleep, could i instead break it down into 3 hours, 3 hours, 2 hours distributed over 24 hours in a day?	similarly, dimming the lights at night and maintaining quiet hours may also help babies begin to sleep more at night than during the day. of course, this schedule is only an example. different infants might sleep at different times of day or for different lengths of time depending on their parents' schedules and activities. the same infant might also sleep at different times on different days. there is no single, specific sleep schedule 3-month-old babies should follow. instead, like newborns, most 3-month-old infants should sleep multiple times day and night, for a total sleep time of between 16 and 17 hours per 24-hour period.	17 hours
what are things i should do before i go to bed?	sf: so it's about creating a positive association with sleep and the bedroom, as opposed to a negative one, and creating the bedroom as a place they should look forward to. i think the problem that we have these days is that we're all doing too much. we have a 24/7 lifestyle, often becoming over-attached to technology and especially mobile phones. now we've got the work/life balance and work-from-home problem. we are working later into the night, and having time to ourselves and time for our kids becomes hard. it's hard to juggle that. i encourage all the clients who i work with to really plan it out: look at when you're going to give the time to your children, look at how you're fitting your life around their needs, and that you're getting the things that you need to relax and switch off at night, too.	relax and switch off at night
how does sleep deprivation affect my health and well-being?	sex can contribute to your overall health and well-being. studies show that orgasm, whether from sex with a partner or masturbation, can help you sleep better. the relationship between sex and sleep is bidirectional, which means that in addition to sex affecting sleep, sleep impacts a person's sex life. sleeping for longer periods has been linked to higher sexual desire and arousal, and sleep deprivation can reduce these feelings. also, men who work hours that disrupt sleep or live with certain sleep disorders may be at a higher risk for erectile dysfunction. learn more about the stages of sex, how sleep and sex affect one another, and how you can improve both your sleep and sexual health.	sleep deprivation can reduce these feelings
