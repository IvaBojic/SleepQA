what determines whether someone is a light or heavy sleeper?	researchers still do not know what makes someone a light sleeper or heavy sleeper. genetics, an underlying sleep disorder, or aspects of the bedroom environment can all contribute. people who are light sleepers can wake up to small disturbances like a car passing by or a street lamp turning on. heavy sleepers, on the other hand, need something much more stimulating to wake up, like a blaring alarm clock. the differences in sensitivity to these stimuli are due to what doctors call an arousal threshold. an arousal threshold describes how strong a stimulus must be to wake you up.	genetics, an underlying sleep disorder, or aspects of the bedroom environment
what lighting is most suitable for sleeping conditions?	some of the best bedroom colors for sleep include the slate blue of a cloudy sky, bluish lavender, soft grey, or even a creamy white with slight blue undertones. warmer tones should be used only as subtle accents. don't forget about light when optimizing your bedroom for better sleep. while blue - toned paint is good, blue light from electronics and certain light bulbs is not. it's the part of the visible spectrum that has the most impact on your natural sleep - wake cycles and avoiding it may improve your sleep significantly. artificial blue light may have this effect on our sleep - wake cycles because it mimics the effects of sunlight on our circadian rhythms.	blue light
can i catch up on sleep during the weekends?	it also puts us at risk for drowsy driving accidents. going short on sleep also makes us more likely to reach for high - calorie snacks and eat later in the day, raising the risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease later in life. it is possible to catch up on sleep by receiving recovery sleep. during recovery sleep, most people show an increased proportion of slow wave sleep that is thought to help compensate for previous sleep loss. sleeping in on the weekend may help improve insulin sensitivity, fat metabolism, body weight, stress levels, daytime sleepiness, fatigue, alertness, and performance.	it is possible to catch up on sleep by receiving recovery sleep
is it the longer you sleep, the less tired feeling you have?	individuals vary in terms of how much sleep they need within the average range. however, if you find you are sleeping significantly more than nine hours or less than seven, it could be a sign of a sleep disorder or underlying health condition. as we age, we sleep less. whether older adults actually need less sleep, or their brains are not able to regulate sleep to the same extent, is unknown. a reported 1 in 4 older adults experience tiredness that interferes with their daytime plans. perhaps for these reasons, older adults also nap more often.	we sleep less

will taking supplements e.g. valerian root, magnesium help with my sleep?	the juice, which can be very sour, is usually diluted in a small amount of water before drinking. magnesium is a dietary mineral naturally present in food and often added to processed foods. it is used throughout the body and is present in our bones, soft tissue, and blood. older adults are more at risk for magnesium deficiency, and one of the mineral's many roles is sleep regulation. some research suggests that supplemental magnesium may help reduce insomnia in older adults, either when used alone or with melatonin and zinc. it may also reduce excessive daytime sleepiness in adults.	reduce insomnia in older adults, either when used alone or with melatonin and zinc
how does studies and sleep co-related to each other?	the same correlation has also been found in studies using polysomnography, which is a type of in - depth sleep study done in a specialized clinic. because it involves close observation of a sleeper, polysomnography provides greater confidence than some other studies that rely on surveys of self - reported sleep apnea or teeth grinding. while research studies have shown a correlation between sleep apnea and sleep - related bruxism, they don't clearly explain the underlying nature of that association. sleep scientists have formulated several hypotheses about how these conditions are connected. these hypotheses include that osa triggers sleep - related bruxism, that sleep bruxism triggers osa, that they occur independently, and that they are involved in a complex and multidimensional relationship.	they don't clearly explain the underlying nature of that association.
is music good for sleeping?	62 percent of people listen to music to help them sleep. the genre isn't important, so long as the music relaxes you. close your eyes, listen to the music, and let it distract you from your worries and calm you down. other types of audio can be good for sleep too, like ambient sounds and white or pink noise. pink noise, like rain or waves, has been shown to improve sleep quality, while white noise may help you fall asleep faster by masking other sounds. you can find playlists for different types of white noise on spotify and smart home devices like alexa.	other types of audio can be good for sleep too, like ambient sounds and white or pink noise

is there a relation between stress and sleep?	stress may reduce deep sleep and rapid eye movement ( rem ) sleep, both of which are important for mental and physical health. stress can color the patterns and emotional content of dreams. the level of the stress hormone cortisol has important implications for the sleep - wake cycle. while cortisol usually decreases at night in preparation for sleep, studies have found that people with insomnia have higher levels of cortisol in the evening, which are linked in turn to a greater number of nighttime awakenings. however, more research is needed to know whether high cortisol levels cause insomnia or whether sleep problems increase cortisol levels.	may reduce deep sleep and rapid eye movement ( rem ) sleep
the recommended sleep duration is 7-9 hours. what happens if i sleep less than 7 hours on average?	these effects are likely to occur after 24 hours without sleep, but they are also noticeable in people who sleep just two to four hours less than the recommended amount. according to current guidelines, adults should sleep at least seven hours each night. if someone has sleep debt from an all - nighter, then nine hours of sleep is recommended. in the long term, not getting enough sleep puts adults at higher risk for certain negative health outcomes. as all of these conditions are potentially fatal, chronic sleep deprivation is also associated with an increased risk of death.	if someone has sleep debt from an all - nighter, then nine hours of sleep is recommended.
is the 10 minutes snooze beneficial to human body?	daytime sleeping doesn't have to interfere with your normal sleep schedule if you follow some guidelines. you might think that a longer nap produces more benefits, but sometimes less is more. a study found that naps lasting between 10 and 30 minutes are often the most beneficial. following a period of sleep deprivation, a 5 - minute nap results in very few advantages when compared to not napping at all. a 10 - minute afternoon nap, however, is shown to produce a number of immediate gains, including increased energy and cognitive function. the benefits of a 10 - minute nap can last as long as 155 minutes.	the benefits of a 10 - minute nap can last as long as 155 minutes.
can one ever have too much sleep?	even now there's a piece of research done recently that indicated it's regarded as masculine to be underslept. this is despite all the scientific evidence proving that a good night's sleep is vital to our short - and long - term health. people who sleep too much are looked down on. people who get the right amount of sleep, well why do you need that much? when i left university, i went into advertising, and i was highly stressed. i used alcohol to get to sleep, and then once i decided i didn't want to drink anymore, i couldn't get to sleep.	people who sleep too much are looked down on.
does sleeping in the afternoon have negative effects?	energy levels tend to plummet in the afternoon, making it a popular time to nap. sleep latency ( how quickly we fall asleep ) and sleep efficiency are greater in naps taken between 3 p. m. and 5 p. m. research shows that evening naps result in more sleep inertia, leaving you feeling less refreshed. because circadian rhythm influences nap outcomes, it makes sense to strategically time your nap, especially if you're a shift worker. studies show that cognitive performance and energy levels improve when a nap is taken early on during a period of extended wakefulness. it's also important to nap early enough in the day that the nap doesn't interfere with falling asleep at bedtime.	energy levels tend to plummet
if i wear glasses that blocks blue light, does that mean using electronic devices right before bed will not have any impact on my sleep?	if possible, keep electronic devices out of the bedroom entirely, to remove the impulse to remain connected and to avoid notifications. if you can't get electronics completely out of your bedroom, turn their brightness down as far as possible, try not to use them for an hour before bedtime, and keep them silenced during the night. if you keep electronics in the bedroom, you may benefit from tools that block blue light. special glasses can filter blue light to keep it from reaching your eye, which may cut down on the effect of blue light on your sleep.	cut down on the effect of blue light on your sleep.

is it true that lavender scents help me to fall asleep faster?	anyone with sleeping problems should talk with a doctor, and unless directed by a health professional, aromatherapy should not replace other treatments for insomnia or sleep disorders. among essential oils, few have been studied as much as lavender. lavender has been associated with improved sleep in multiple research studies, including in some people with insomnia. the smell of lavender has calming effects on heart rate and blood pressure as well as mood. in a study of people exposed to lavender before bed, deep sleep increased, leading to feeling more refreshed in the morning. roses have a reputation for their appealing fragrance, and rose essential oils have shown potential as aromatherapy for sleep.	deep sleep increased, leading to feeling more refreshed in the morning.
what is sleep paralysis?	people may fall asleep at any moment, with brief naps ranging from just a few seconds to several minutes. they often wake from these short naps feeling much more alert and awake. during lapses in attention or brief periods of sleep, people with narcolepsy may perform activities with no conscious awareness and little memory of them afterward. while performing habitual activities, like eating, talking or typing, they may fall asleep and automatically continue the activity. usually, their performance declines, with a common example being writing that becomes an illegible scribble during brief sleep attacks. sleep paralysis is a temporary loss of voluntary muscle control while waking up or falling asleep.	a temporary loss of voluntary muscle control while waking up or falling asleep
does my gene affect how i sleep?	since then, they've found a large number of genetic markers in humans as well. studies of insomnia in families, twins, and large genome - wide association studies ( gwas ) have found multiple genes that are connected to insomnia. a genome is an individual's unique combination of genes, and gwas look at the genomes of large groups of people. the genes that may cause insomnia are tied to the same processes that regulate your sleep - wake cycle, and whether you feel awake and alert, or sleepy and relaxed. these genes may affect hormones and neurotransmitters involved in your circadian rhythm, such as serotonin, adenosine, gaba, and hypocretin / orexin.	awake and alert, or sleepy and relaxed
how effective is melatonin supplements to help me sleep?	melatonin supplements can be purchased over - the - counter and used as a short - term sleep aid. in some cases, a doctor may recommend prescription medication to help you stay asleep. certain medications can have serious side effects and should only be used as prescribed. being a light sleeper can be frustrating, but there are steps you can take to sleep more deeply. if you still feel tired after taking steps to improve your sleep hygiene and bedroom environment, consult your doctor. they can provide additional recommendations based on your personal medical history, or refer you to a specialist to determine if an underlying condition is contributing to your sleep troubles.	can be purchased over - the - counter and used as a short - term sleep aid.

is there a way of traning myself to gain more rem sleep within a limited sleep duration?	for example, one person might sleep text during rem sleep while acting out a dream, because they have rem sleep behavior disorder. another person might sleep text during a confusional arousal, because they hear a text alert while in a state between sleep and wakefulness and reply to the message. regardless of when in the sleep cycle sleep texting occurs, certain factors might make its occurrence more likely. although the causes of texting while asleep are not yet certain, existing research on parasomnias in general suggests there are multiple actions a person can take to reduce or prevent parasomnias from occurring.	one person might sleep text during rem sleep while acting out a dream
how does late night snacks affect my overall sleep?	late - night snacks can also disrupt your sleep, particularly if they have a high fat or sugar content. when you exercise, your body temperature rises to give you energy. for some people, exercising at night has no impact on their sleep. for others, the energy boost from exercise can make it harder to settle into sleep. if you nap too long during the day, it can reduce your sleep drive later that night, making it harder to fall and stay asleep. a short, 20 - to 30 - minute power nap can give you a boost, but anything longer than that can lead to interrupted sleep.	can also disrupt your sleep, particularly if they have a high fat or sugar content
how to treat insomia	treatment for sexsomnia depends on the underlying cause. for people whose sexsomnia is related to another parasomnia, being prescribed a benzodiazepine may be helpful. sexsomnia associated with other sleep disorders is usually relieved by treating the underlying problem, such as the use of continuous positive airway pressure ( cpap ) machine or a mandibular advancement device for obstructive sleep apnea. cases of sexsomnia caused by seizures respond well to anticonvulsant therapy. as sexsomnia appears to be caused by a wide range of conditions, your doctor may prescribe treatment options related to your unique circumstances. they may also suggest that you make lifestyle changes to avoid potential triggers and take steps to ensure your safety and the safety of others in your home until the condition is under control.	depends on the underlying cause
