does having jet lag affect my sleep cycle?,"jet lag can occur when a person travels rapidly across multiple time zones, such as on an intercontinental flight, because their body's internal clock becomes misaligned with the local day - night cycle. evidence from small research studies points to melatonin supplements as potentially helping to reset the sleep - wake cycle and improve sleep in people with jet lag. shift workers - people who work during the night - often struggle with sleep difficulties related to a misaligned circadian rhythm. studies of melatonin in shift workers have had inconclusive results, although some people report a benefit. there is debate about whether melatonin is beneficial in otherwise healthy adults who have insomnia, a persistent condition marked by trouble falling asleep or staying asleep.","all of these factors contribute to feeling exhausted after a long flight; however, this is distinct from jet lag. unlike jet lag, travel fatigue does not involve circadian rhythm disruption. for that reason, while travel fatigue usually goes away after a good night's sleep, jet lag can persist for days or weeks until a person's internal clock becomes realigned. it is possible to have both travel fatigue and jet lag after a long-haul flight, but jet lag is far more likely to cause lasting and extensive symptoms. jet lag can have ruinous effects on a vacation, business trip, or athletic competition.",reset the sleep - wake cycle and improve sleep,jet lag is far more likely to cause lasting and extensive symptoms,2.0,3.0
