what does help researchers to learn about the importance of sleep?	how is sleep different for men and women	research has conclusively demonstrated that sleep is essential for human health. it allows the brain and body to rest and recover, enabling better physical, mental, and emotional well-being. while sleep is necessary for everyone, there are important differences in sleep for men and women. historically, sleep research has focused disproportionately on males, leaving gaps in knowledge about sleep differences between sexes. in recent years, though, sleep science has worked to broaden its understanding of both gender- and sex-based differences in sleep. studies have cast light on how sleep disorders affect each group in distinct ways and how the quantity and quality of sleep diverge between women and men.
what may enable more restful sleep?	rest vs. sleep: whats the difference	it can be tricky to find time for rest in our hectic, plugged-in lives. however, if you think of rest as just as essential as sleeping, then you're more likely to prioritize behaviors that promote relaxation. adopting a rest routine around the same time each day can lead to consistent, positive results. many people find that evening rituals like listening to music, reading, or a bath helps them sleep better, which in turn allows you to feel more relaxed during the day. the workplace is a source of stress for many people, but taking a break to rest may actually increase productivity.
what percentage of women are report sleeping problems and higher rates of insomnia during perimenopause and menopause?	how can menopause affect sleep	a woman's ovaries gradually decrease production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone during perimenopause, a period of seven to ten years prior to menopause. these hormonal changes contribute to sleep issues that often continue into postmenopause, the period after menopause. menopausal symptoms can vary from woman to woman and throughout perimenopause into menopause. sleep issues are common, with sleep disorders affecting 39 to 47 percent of perimenopausal women and 35 to 60 percent of postmenopausal women. the most common sleep problems reported by women going through menopause include hot flashes, insomnia, sleep-disordered breathing, and other mood and sleep disorders.
who has an enviable life?	how much sleep your dog needs	dogs have an enviable life. after sleeping all night, they spend their days napping in sunbeams and dozing on the couch. when they do wake up, they're often energetic enough for an immediate game of fetch. animals like dogs sleep differently than humans do, and these differences can cause many dog owners to wonder if their dog is sleeping too much or not enough. there's more than one answer to the question of how many hours of sleep a dog needs every day. like us, dogs may need more or less sleep depending on their age, health, location, and lifestyle.
why do couples gravitate towards hybrid models?	foam vs. spring mattress	couples often gravitate toward these models because they combine bounce and motion isolation. hybrids also frequently have more supportive edges, which can increase the usable surface area for those sharing their bed. mattress choices are highly subjective, and what is ideal for one sleeper may be uncomfortable for another. assessing what you're looking for in a mattress and understanding the differences between mattress types can point you in the right direction. spring mattresses - pros & cons. spring mattresses - by sleeping position.
what are symptoms of travel fatigue?	how to sleep well when traveling	travel fatigue can cause headaches, feelings of being disoriented, and make it difficult to get enough sleep. some research suggests that travel-related fatigue can even exacerbate certain medical problems. some people may be more susceptible to travel fatigue than others. research suggests that people with a rigid sleep schedule may experience more severe travel fatigue than those with more flexible sleep habits. traveling often requires being open to new experiences. this can be one of the most exciting parts of being far from home, but it can also make it more difficult to relax. many people find it harder to fall asleep in an unfamiliar place, like a hotel room, a vacation rental, or a friend or family member's house.
what does stress represent?	the relationship between sleep and stress	stress is an important part of human biology that allows people to react quickly and decisively in the face of challenging or dangerous situations. however, too much stress can have a profound impact on sleep and overall health. surveys suggest the stress of the covid-19 pandemic has taken a significant toll on sleep quality, with one study finding that 41% of people experienced negative changes to their sleep quality in large part due to covid-related stress. we examine how stress levels can affect sleep quality and how poor sleep in turn can affect stress levels. we also provide actionable advice on how to manage stress and improve sleep habits.
why do carnivores tend to sleep more than herbivores?	how much sleep your dog needs	by learning more about how dogs sleep, it's easier to understand your own dog's sleep patterns and notice any changes or causes for concern. dogs require a significant amount of sleep, even more than we do. carnivores like dogs tend to sleep more than herbivores since sleep is more dangerous for prey animals. however, the total amount of sleep a dog needs can vary depending on a range of factors. of these, age is the most important and has the greatest impact on a dog's sleep schedule. dogs can adapt to most situations. a study of shelter dogs who slept less during the day due to the hustle and bustle of a shelter environment found that they slept more deeply at night and woke up less often.
why do doctors often look for mental health disorders in people with parkinson's disease who have sleep problems?	parkinsons disease: sleep disturbances and fatigue	these may be a result of medications or cognitive impairment. in turn, excessive daytime sleepiness (eds) may occur as a consequence of sleeping poorly at night. it may also be triggered by medications. parkinson's patients who suffer from eds may be at a higher risk of accidents and unable to safely carry out activities such as operating a motor vehicle. since insomnia frequently goes hand-in-hand with anxiety and depression, it may be a contributing factor to sleep problems in people with parkinson's disease. for that reason, doctors often look for mental health disorders in people with parkinson's disease who have sleep problems.
what is the relationship between bed size and cost?	how much does a mattress cost	mattress size: the price of a mattress will scale directly with the size. smaller beds, such as twins, generally cost about half as much as large king size beds. less popular bed sizes, including california king and twin xl are also slightly more expensive than similarly sized mattresses in more traditional sizes. refer to the table above to get an idea of mattress prices by size. in-person: while it may seem logical to purchase a mattress in a brick-and-mortar store where you can test it out, it will almost always be more expensive to go this route.
what happens if an underlying cause of hypersomnia can't be found?	what is dyssomnia	naps do not always relieve the symptoms. hypersomnia may have an underlying cause, such as narcolepsy, medication, or a medical disorder. drug therapy may reduce the symptoms of excessive sleepiness. extrinsic sleep disorders are dyssomnias caused by factors outside of the body, such as environment and health habits. sleep hygiene is overall care for your sleep habits. poor sleep hygiene can negatively impact both the quantity and quality of sleep you get at night. without sufficient sleep, you may feel sleepy during the day and struggle to concentrate. a lack of sleep can also impact your ability to drive.
what does scn release when exposed to light?	what is circadian rhythm	the scn receives signals directly from the eyes, making it highly sensitive to changes in light. as part of the sleep-wake cycle, the scn uses environmental cues to tell the body when to feel tired and when to wake up. the circadian rhythm works in tandem with a function called the homeostatic sleep drive to induce sleepiness at the correct time of day. when the eye is exposed to light, the scn releases chemicals and hormones that promote alertness. in dim light or darkness, the brain responds by telling the pineal gland to secrete the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin.
how do cpap machines work?	apap vs. cpap	cpap machines, which stands for continuous positive airway pressure machines, work by pushing a steady stream of pressurized air through the nostrils, opening up the muscles that improperly relax in people with sleep apnea. the machine takes in air through a filter, often passing it through a heated humidifier so that it's easier on the nose and throat. it then uses a built-in motor to push the filtered, humidified air through a tube attached to the machine. at the end of the tube is a mask that is worn over the nose and affixed to the head with straps.
what is the purpose of a sleep dictionary?	sleep dictionary: definitions of common sleep terms	our goal is to make sure that you get the most out of our evidence-based resources by better understanding key issues that affect your sleep. because of their complexity, sleep disorders are not covered in this sleep dictionary. readers looking for information about sleep disorders are encouraged to visit our landing page for sleep disorders. there you can find a general overview as well as links to in-depth resources about specific conditions.
what can sleep studies find?	understanding sleep studies for seniors	when they identify the cause of sleeping problems, these studies can help put older people on a pathway to healthier sleep. it can be difficult to find reliable information on sleep studies for older adults, so we focus on accurate, up-to-date research about sleep studies and review practical information for older adults to improve their nightly sleep. sleep studies can often find the underlying cause of poor sleep by detecting many sleep-related disorders, like sleep apnea or periodic limb movement disorder. these and other conditions frequently affect older adults, making it harder for them to get a sufficient amount of restorative sleep.
what happens when there is delayed sleep timing?	circadian rhythm sleep disorders	insomnia - difficulty falling or staying asleep - is another common issue associated with these disorders. as these criteria demonstrate, circadian rhythm sleep disorders can provoke significant health effects including problems in work or school as well as an elevated risk of vehicular or workplace accidents. delayed sleep-wake phase disorder occurs when a person's sleep-wake cycle is pushed back more than two hours beyond what is considered a typical sleep schedule. a delayed circadian rhythm can cause people to struggle with falling asleep at night and waking up earlier in the morning. people with this condition often suffer from lack of sleep if they have school or work obligations that require an early wake-up time.
what can changes to daily routine do?	sleeps impact on youth athletics and physical development	kids in this age group are still developing the physical skills they need to play organized sports. at this age, some children may begin to drop their daily nap. like teens and adults, however, young children who are especially active may benefit from additional sleep. bedtime routines can help preschool-aged kids fall asleep more easily. children who follow a regular bedtime routine are more likely to consistently sleep better. routines have also shown to improve kids' and parents' moods, lower household stress levels, and lead to better learning outcomes. to help your preschooler get more sleep, consider implementing a 30-40 minute bedtime routine that combines physical contact like cuddling, language-based activities like storytelling or singing, and hygiene activities like brushing teeth or bathing.
what should you do if you are aiming to wake up earlier?	tips for shift workers: how to get better sleep	shift workers with rotating schedules should prepare for shift changes by adjusting their sleep times. let's say you are currently working a day shift and planning to rotate to a night shift the following week. you should gradually delay your bedtime by one or two hours each night a few days prior to starting the night shift if possible. this will help you get enough rest and avoid sudden changes. some rotating shifts are better for sleep than others. for example, rotating from day to afternoon to night shifts is a more natural progression that is easier on your body compared to rotating in the opposite direction or in random patterns.
what can exposure to electric light at night do?	what are lucid dream masks	exposure to electric light at night, even for short periods of time and in dim settings, can disrupt a person's circadian rhythm. similarly, environmental noise exposure triggers a stress response that can disturb sleep and lead to sleep deprivation the following day. researchers warn that regularly inducing lucid dreams has two potential drawbacks. it can blur the lines between fantasy and reality, and it may reduce your sleep quality. lucid dreamers display increased prefrontal cortical brain activity during sleep. in normal sleep, activity in this brain area is inhibited. further, the wbtb lucid dreaming technique is rooted in disrupting sleep, which may lead to more sleep issues.
what is a central component of sleep hygiene beyond just habits?	what is sleep hygiene	a central component of sleep hygiene beyond just habits is your sleep environment. to fall asleep more easily, you want your bedroom to emanate tranquility. the basic concept of sleep hygiene - that your environment and habits can be optimized for better sleep - applies to just about everyone, but what ideal sleep hygiene looks like can vary based on the person. for that reason, it's worth testing out different adjustments to find out what helps your sleep the most. you don't have to change everything at once; small steps can move you toward better sleep hygiene.
what is the defining feature of each mattress type?	edge support	when a model is zoned, it features targeted support intended to promote good sleep posture. to achieve this, the mattress is usually firmer in the center third. therefore, the center of the edge may also feel more stable, which could be beneficial for those who like to sit along the perimeter. mattress type is determined largely by the composition of the core, which also gives the bed the majority of its edge support. we'll highlight the most common types of mattresses and explain how their cores affect their perimeters. innerspring & hybrid: the coil support systems of innerspring and hybrid models generally provide sturdier edges than alternative options.
what percentage of people with asthma also experience gerd symptoms?	reasons for waking up gasping for air	people with asthma may wake up wheezing. in turn, poor sleep may exacerbate asthma symptoms. taking daily asthma medication as recommended by your doctor may relieve symptoms of nocturnal asthma. acid reflux describes a condition when stomach acid flows upward into the esophagus. approximately one in five adults in the u.s. have gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd), in which acid reflux symptoms are chronic or severe. symptoms of gerd often worsen after eating or when lying down. people with gerd may experience nighttime awakenings and symptoms such as heartburn, regurgitation, coughing, or choking. gerd symptoms can also trigger asthma.
what is the official treatment for maladaptive daydreaming?	maladaptive daydreaming: symptoms and diagnosis	they can also recommend specific strategies for managing your symptoms. for example, grounding techniques can be helpful. some therapists may also recommend changing your daydream's plot endings from good to bad to make the daydream less rewarding. if you feel addicted to daydreaming, or like your daydreams interfere with your daily life, talk to your doctor. they can provide recommendations for controlling your tendency to daydream and provide tips for better focus and better sleep.
what should you do if you're unsure of how to implement healthy sleep habits in your life?	healthy sleep: what is it and are you getting it	if you aren't sure how to implement healthy sleep habits in your life, talk with your doctor. it's also important to speak with a health professional if you already engage in good sleep hygiene practices and continue to struggle with sleep or if you are concerned that you may have a sleep disorder. your doctor can help you evaluate factors that could be impacting your sleep and discuss strategies or interventions to help you sleep better.
what kind of mattresses are box springs primarily used for?	do you need a box spring	over a decade ago, a box spring was essentially required when buying a new mattress. today, that's not necessarily the case. most modern mattresses including mattresses in a box do not require a box spring. in fact, many newer foam and latex beds can actually be damaged by using a traditional box spring that doesn't provide the rigid support needed for these mattress types. box springs are primarily designed for use with coil-based mattresses. this means innersprings and hybrids are the best mattress types to use with box springs. box springs are designed for use with innerspring beds, and some models do not provide the same type of rigid support needed for a foam bed.
what percentage of people have night eating syndrome?	night eating syndrome: symptoms, causes, and treatments	night eating syndrome describes a condition in which a person eats a large proportion of their daily food intake at night, either after dinner or during nighttime awakenings. the condition involves symptoms found in some mood, sleep, and eating disorders, but is its own unique illness. researchers estimate that approximately 1.5% of people have night eating syndrome. this disorder has a prevalence of 6% to 16% in people with obesity, although it is difficult to say whether one condition causes the other. night eating syndrome is also more common in people with depression or other psychiatric disorders.
what are the inherent risk of getting the inspire sleep apnea treatment?	what is inspire sleep apnea treatment and does it work	because the treatment makes it easier to breathe, you're less likely to snore, stop breathing, gasp, or choke. this increases your overall sleep quality. users report noticing the pulsing sensation beneath their chins while awake but not after falling asleep. the stimulation should not be uncomfortable or painful, though it is noticeable. you should not feel discomfort related to the device in your chest. getting the inspire sleep apnea treatment requires outpatient surgery, which comes with inherent risks, like infection, pain, and swelling. additionally, some individuals report temporary tongue weakness for a few weeks following the procedure.
what are the three components of asv machines?	asv machines: what they are and how they work	sometimes, these problems resolve on their own as the person becomes accustomed to the cpap device. however, for people who continue to experience central apneic events, asv can encourage a more regular breathing pattern. by lowering the air pressure when the person is breathing normally, the asv machine helps avoid situations in which the brain decides to stop breathing based on the low levels of carbon dioxide in the blood. since asv also delivers air mechanically, it also helps treat obstructive sleep apnea events. like cpap devices, asv machines consist of three basic parts: a face mask, the machine, and a flexible hose that connects the mask to the machine.
what is hypersomnolence?	sleep disorders - common types, symptoms, treatments	they may also occur during the transition between sleep and wakefulness. these disorders are characterized by abnormal breathing during sleep. for some, the individual will also experience abnormal breathing while they are awake. some breathing disorders are highly disruptive for sleep and can lead to major daytime impairments. sleep apnea, a common breathing disorder for children and adults, can also cause heavy snoring. hypersomnolence refers to feelings of sleepiness and fatigue during the day despite a healthy circadian rhythm and an adequate amount of sleep the previous night. these feelings may lead to involuntary lapses into drowsiness or sleep, which in turn puts people at risk for accidents.
why are toppers helpful?	mattress pad vs. mattress topper	toppers are also useful when a person doesn't want to replace a mattress but would still like to change the feel of their bed. like mattress pads, toppers come in a range of styles and materials. some are made to optimize pressure relief, while others are designed to isolate motion and/or keep sleepers cool. knowing exactly how you want to modify your sleep experience can help you choose the right type. while a mattress pad might add some cushioning, a memory foam topper can provide an even deeper level of pressure relief. memory foam cradles the body and alleviates tension, making it a good choice for side sleepers or lightweight people with very firm mattresses.
what prevents people from acting out their dreams?	fever dreams: causes and meaning	because most dreams take place during rem sleep, when leg and arm muscles are temporarily paralyzed, sleepers are unlikely to act out their dreams. however, sleepers may experience unpleasant or negative dreams. they may wake feeling unsettled or uncomfortable. while there is no single way to prevent fever dreams, resolving the fever itself can reduce the likelihood of them occurring. be sure to consult your doctor if you experience additional or worsened symptoms with your fever.
when is polysomnography able to record?	how is actigraphy used to evaluate sleep	while actigraphy may not provide the most detailed information, it offers a broad overview for sleepers and is easy to use. polysomnography offers thorough information for medical professionals to evaluate, but the results may be affected by having to sleep in a lab. a sleep log is a simple, affordable way to track sleep habits, but it requires consistency. results can also be affected by how the sleeper feels about their rest. if an actigraphy assessment is appropriate for your situation, your doctor or sleep specialist will provide an fda-approved device and work with you to carry out testing. you may have seen commercially available wearable products, such as smart watches or fitbits, marketed with claims that they provide information about sleep parameters by measuring movement, heart rate, and other features. currently there is not enough research to approve these commercial products as diagnostic or treatment tools, though they may provide helpful additional information about your sleep habits.
what can failing to get enough sleep lead to?	sleep and school performance	roughly two-thirds of high school students report that they do not get enough sleep, yet research shows that getting adequate rest is vital to school performance and overall health. failing to get the recommended hours of sleep each night can cause issues with concentration, grades and test scores, and the motivation to achieve. learning about the benefits of sleep for school performance may help students recognize the risks of skipping sleep and the advantages of building healthy habits. sleep is vital for students to learn new information at school, home, and as they interact with the world around them.
what kind of neurodevelopmental issues are linked to preterm birth?	how much sleep do babies need	a premature or preterm baby is born prior to 37 weeks of pregnancy. while the effects of preterm birth vary considerably from child to child, many of these babies and newborns experience sleep disturbances during their first two years of life. these issues may include shorter naps during the day and reduced sleep duration at night compared to babies born at full term. lower sleep quality may also be a factor. like full-term babies, preterm newborns and infants need roughly 14 to 17 hours of sleep for each 24-hour period. preterm birth has been linked to neurodevelopmental issues related to language, motor skills, and behavior.
what is considered shift work?	tips for shift workers: how to get better sleep	we will continue to monitor and revise this article as new literature is published on sleep strategies for shift workers. work schedules that fall anywhere outside the hours of 7 am to 6 pm are considered shift work. these schedules may consist of fixed hours, rotating or split shifts, or irregular work times. according to the bureau of labor statistics, roughly 16% of full-time salary and wage workers in the u.s. worked non-daytime shifts in 2017 and 2018. recently, many employees have also been forced to take on shift work in recent months due to the covid-19 pandemic.
what is parkinson's disease?	parkinsons disease: sleep disturbances and fatigue	parkinson's disease is a complex movement disorder thought to affect as many as 1 million people in the united states. it is more common in older adults, affecting 10 percent of those over 80 years old. while most symptoms can be managed medically, there is currently no known cure. it's estimated that two-thirds of those afflicted with parkinson's disease struggle to get quality sleep. in fact, sleep problems are increasingly recognized as a potential early indicator of parkinson's disease. sleep disturbances in parkinson's patients are contributing risk factors for cognitive decline, and cognitive decline itself is known to exacerbate sleep disturbances.
why might one opt for a mattress that uses silica-treated rayon or kevlar?	is memory foam toxic	individuals who wish to avoid memory foam can find plenty of natural alternatives. a popular substitute is natural latex, a material derived from the sap of rubber trees that is breathable, durable, and more bouncy than memory foam. more rarely, some hybrid beds may combine an innerspring core with naturally derived comfort layers made of wool, cotton batting, or feathers.
how much calories do we burn when we sleep?	how your body uses calories while you sleep	many people are surprised to discover how many calories we burn while sleeping. although sleeping requires far less energy than most daytime activities, it's still an active period for our brain and certain other bodily functions. the exact number of calories burned sleeping depends on a complex interplay between sleep, diet, exercise, and other variables. if you are having trouble with weight management or energy levels, an understanding of the factors that influence metabolism may help you regain control of your health. as a very approximate number, we burn around 50 calories an hour while we sleep.
what can you do if you become tired of the standard lullabies?	the best ways to relieve stress so you can sleep soundly	while stress is the body's natural response to protecting itself, chronic stress or anxiety can have many long-term effects, including poor sleep or even sleepless nights. stress invokes the fight or flight feeling. this elevates the heart rate, quickens breathing, and increases stress hormones in the body. anxiety is stress that continues after the stressor is gone, and it produces similar physiological effects. during times of unwanted stress and anxiety, relaxation techniques can produce the body's natural relaxation response. this includes a slower heart rate and breathing pattern, a lower blood pressure, and an overall feeling of calm.
what percentage of sleep paralysis episodes involve hallucinations that are distinct from typical dreams?	what is a false awakening	a person with sleep paralysis is mentally awake but unable to move most of their muscles, mirroring the muscle paralysis that occurs naturally during rem sleep. sleep paralysis can happen as you are falling asleep or waking up. researchers have found that about 75% of the time, hallucinations occur with sleep paralysis. for example, the sleeper may feel as if they sense an intruder entering the room. an out-of-body sensation may also accompany sleep paralysis. sleep paralysis and false awakenings are similar states that fall between sleep and wakefulness, in which a person looks asleep.
what can delay the onset of melatonin?	how to create a calming sleep environment for your child	this can reduce your child's separation anxiety and help them learn to fall asleep without your help. avoid leaving a bottle with your baby overnight, as this can lead to tooth decay. bright lights from electronic screens and even household lighting can delay the onset of the sleep hormone, melatonin, making it harder to fall asleep. blackout curtains in the baby or toddler room are an affordable and easy option for keeping out external light. they may be especially convenient for daytime naps, early bedtimes, or bedrooms that let in excessive street light. the darker the sleep environment, the better.
what should you do to minimize the effects of medication on your sleep?	sleeping pills: medications & prescription sleep aids	remember that these drugs are generally not intended for long-term use. the goal is to help improve your sleep in the short-term while allowing you to develop healthy sleep hygiene that can pay off over the long-term. double-check with your doctor or pharmacist about whether the dosage is right for you. for example, women eliminate sleep aids differently, so the fda has recommended a lower dose of some sleep medications because of numerous reports of excessive next-day grogginess. the dosage should also be calibrated to whether you have problems falling asleep or staying asleep. carefully follow all the instructions for taking your sleep medication.
what negative health conditions is nocturia associated with?	how is sleep different for men and women	frequent urination at night, known as nocturia, can hinder sleep and affects more than 75% of women over age 40, often because of a connection to higher rates of incontinence and overactive bladder in women. women are more likely to experience heartburn and acid reflux, which can worsen overall sleep. gender-based influences on sleep are closely intertwined with social and cultural norms that have unequal impacts on women and men. because these norms are complex, they may implicate sleep in multifaceted ways that are not the same for all individuals. caregiving is a prime example of a gender-based factor that affects sleep.
what is a principal driver of your sleep routine?	how to reset your sleep routine	by creating habits and cues that promote sleep, the norm becomes falling asleep quickly and staying asleep through the night. with more repetition, the routine gets reinforced, facilitating increasingly stable sleep patterns over time. circadian rhythm is a principal driver of your sleep routine. it is a 24-hour cycle that is part of the body's internal clock. circadian rhythm is crucial to managing the delicate balance between sleep and wakefulness, helping us be alert or drowsy at the appropriate time. light exposure is an essential influence on circadian rhythm, which is closely aligned with the day-night cycle.
what is somniloquy?	sleep talking	sleep talking, formally known as somniloquy, is a sleep disorder defined as talking during sleep without being aware of it. sleep talking can involve complicated dialogues or monologues, complete gibberish or mumbling. the good news is that for most people it is a rare and short-lived occurrence. it's common for people to experience at least one episode of sleep talking during their life, making it one of the most common abnormal behaviors that can occur during sleep. research has helped clarify the symptoms and consequences of sleep talking, but there is much that remains unknown about the causes and treatment of this condition.
what does 'weekend migraine' refer to?	sleep deprivation and migraines	while restful sleep can relieve migraine symptoms while they are ongoing, sleeping extensively may make problems worse. the term weekend migraine is often used to refer to migraines that commonly occur in individuals sleeping in on weekends to make up for lost sleep during the week. the relationship between sleep deprivation and migraines is also bidirectional. this means that sleep disturbances can trigger migraines, but migraines can also negatively impact our sleep. migraines can leave us feeling exhausted and excessively sleepy, which may disrupt our sleep-wake cycle. although there is no cure for migraines, there are steps you can take to alleviate your symptoms.
what would doing away with the siesta allow?	travel & sleep: potential sleep disruptions & tips	anxiety in the lead-up to a trip can weigh on both your sleep and peace of mind. try to plan far enough ahead that you aren't scrambling at the last minute to pack, prepare your itinerary, or get to the airport. some people easily doze off on planes, trains, and buses, but for other people, it's a serious challenge. if sleeping in-transit doesn't come naturally to you, try to avoid making travel plans that depend on sleeping on board. a redeye flight or overnight train might seem like a good way to save time or money, but if you can't sleep on board, it can backfire.
when was the uniform time act enacted?	ending daylight saving time: how would it change sleep	daylight saving time itself has been enacted and repealed multiple times in the u.s. after a patchwork of state and local time changes emerged in the mid-20th century, congress passed the uniform time act of 1966 to create a national policy that included dst. if were to establish a stable, year-round time now, which permanent time is the right time? the jury is out on that one. arizona and hawaii already use permanent standard time, as do puerto rico, guam, and the u.s. groups such as the national sleep foundation and the aasm have publicly supported a national policy to abolish daylight saving time.
who does rem rebound tend to occur in?	what is rem rebound	just as experts still do not fully understand how sleep works, they also do not fully understand the causes of rem rebound sleep. however, by studying both humans and animals, ranging from rats to fur seals, researchers have identified multiple potential causes and factors related to rem rebound sleep. more research is required to better understand how these hormones work together to increase rem sleep during a rem rebound effect. although the underlying mechanisms of rem rebound are not fully understood, researchers have identified multiple life factors that seem to cause rem rebound. most commonly, rem rebound appears to occur in response to sleep deprivation, stress, and suppressed rem sleep.
what medical and psychological conditions can lead to eds?	how to treat excessive sleepiness	excessive daytime sleepiness (eds) is the tendency to fall asleep during the daytime when one is expected to be awake. eds can impact alertness, concentration, attention, and overall health. this health concern affects up to 18% of the u.s. eds is not a sleep disorder in itself; instead, it is a symptom of other sleep-related disorders. some psychiatric disorders-especially those that affect mood (anxiety, depression) or psychosis (schizophrenia) -can also impact sleep and can cause eds. heart failure, renal failure, liver failure, and obesity are medical conditions that can contribute to eds. neurological disorders including parkinson's, stroke, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy also can affect eds.
what type of sheets are prone to wrinkles?	how to fold a fitted sheet	folding a fitted sheet can puzzle even the most organized and tidy among us. luckily, you can use a straightforward method that withstands wrinkles and takes up little space in your linen closet. on your next laundry day, instead of crumpling up your fitted sheet in defeat, use our step-by-step directions to achieve a consistent and precise fold. you can ensure a quick process and orderly outcome by taking a few extra steps before folding your sheet. first, make sure to fold your sheet right after washing and drying. you're more likely to avoid wrinkles if you fold sheets shortly after removing them from the dryer.
how long does the body take to metabolize half of the caffeine consumed?	caffeines connection to sleep problems	the effects of caffeine are measured by its half-life, which typically ranges from 4-6 hours. the half-life means the time that your body has metabolized, or processed through, half the caffeine you consumed. as a result, the six-hour half-life of a caffeinated beverage you consume in the afternoon could keep you up at night. some factors can slow or speed up the metabolism of caffeine. nicotine use can reduce the half-life of caffeine by up to 50%, so frequent smokers process through caffeine much quicker, with a half-life as short as two hours. by contrast, pregnant women experience slower caffeine metabolism.
what devices can cause mental overstimulation?	weighted blanket benefits	since stress and anxiety often interfere with sleep, the benefits of a weighted blanket may translate to better sleep for those suffering from stressful thoughts. weighted blankets use deep pressure stimulation, which is thought to stimulate the production of a mood-boosting hormone (serotonin), reduce the stress hormone (cortisol), and increase levels of melatonin, the hormone that helps you sleep. this may help improve overall sleep quality. an overactive nervous system can lead to anxiety, hyperactivity, rapid heart rate, and shortness of breath, which are not conducive to sleep. by distributing an even amount of weight and pressure across the body, weighted blankets may calm the fight-or-flight response and activate the relaxing parasympathetic nervous system in preparation for sleep.
what does the valsalva maneuver entail?	why do we yawn	some have proposed yawning can be a defense mechanism in response to significant altitude changes and other instances where air becomes trapped in the middle ear and cannot escape. yawning causes the eustachian tube in the middle ear to open, releasing air in the process. however, some have rejected this notion because yawning is not the only physiological function that causes the eustachian tube to relax. swallowing also has a similar effect, as does the valsalva maneuver that involves exhaling while pinching the nostrils shut and closing the mouth. more research is needed to determine whether ear pressure relief is a primary reason for yawning.
what percentage of people with asthma experience nocturnal symptoms every night?	does mouth taping stop snoring	studies of nasal strips have produced mixed results, with some showing an improvement in snoring and some showing no effect. around 25% of people in westernized countries experience an allergic reaction to substances they breathe in, such as pollen. this reaction often involves nasal congestion, which can make breathing through the nose more difficult. if you have allergies and find yourself mouth breathing at night, try treating your allergies to see if that helps you breathe more comfortably through the nose. similarly, people who live with asthma should work with a doctor to control symptoms by avoiding triggers and using medication where appropriate.

what is the thickness of most toppers?	mattress pads and topper reviews	most toppers measure 1 to 4 inches thick, so using one is essentially adding an extra comfort layer to your mattress. although the terms mattress topper and mattress pad are often used interchangeably, these are two distinct products. a mattress pad is generally thinner and designed to do two things: provide a minor comfort adjustment and protect the mattress from spills, dirt, and other contaminants. toppers, on the other hand, can significantly change the feel of your mattress but don't provide much protection. most toppers are sold in the six standard sizes for mattresses: twin, twin xl, full, queen, king, and california king.
what is daytime naps a common coping mechanism for?	how circadian rhythms change as we age	it's common for older adults to wake up and fall asleep more suddenly compared to younger adults, leading to the feeling that you are spending most of the night awake. daytime naps are a common coping mechanism for inadequate sleep. however, daytime napping might make it even harder to fall asleep at night. they push bedtime back and set the stage for another sleepless night - and so the cycle continues. on the whole, older adults get much less sleep on average than younger adults, even though their sleep needs are actually the same. most older adults sleep only six-and-a-half to seven hours a night, falling short of the recommended seven to eight hours.
how common is sleep-disordered breathing in people with chiari i malformation?	chiari malformations and sleep apnea	health issues that cause pressure buildup in the skull, such as a tumor or fluid in the brain, can prompt a chiari malformation. certain treatments for other disorders, such as draining cerebrospinal fluid through a shunt or taking a high dose of growth hormone, have also been linked to the development of a chiari malformation. currently there are three commonly accepted types of chiari malformations, as well as several more that are still under debate. chiari malformation type i is the most common. research suggests sleep-disordered breathing occurs in as many as 70% or even 88% of people with chiari i malformation.
why should expectant mothers avoid sleeping flat on their back?	sleeping while pregnant: second trimester	if you're having trouble finding a comfortable position, a recliner may be a good option. stomach sleeping may be fine for the first part of the second trimester, until the growing baby bump makes this position uncomfortable. starting around week 16, you should try to avoid sleeping on your back. this position puts the weight of the uterus on top of the inferior vena cava, which can cut off blood flow, cause swelling in your legs and ankles. if you're not a natural side sleeper, you can try using strategically placed pillows to prevent yourself from rolling over onto your back.

what is daylight hours based on?	light & sleep: effects on sleep quality	the strong lamp is meant to mimic daylight and is often used in the morning to normalize circadian timing. virtually all light can affect sleep, but not all types of light have the same impact. daylight, which in direct sunlight has up to 10,000 lux, a unit to measure illuminance, is far more intense than even bright office lighting, which rarely reaches about 500 lux. for this reason, daylight is a profound influence on sleep and circadian timing. there can be important differences between types of artificial light as well. some types have more illuminance and brightness.
what are some sleep-promoting ingredients in melatonin patches apart from melatonin?	melatonin patches: do they work	possible side effects include headaches, dizziness, irritability, temporary depressive feelings, and stomach cramps. because melatonin also induces sleepiness, you should avoid driving a car or operating heavy machinery while under the effects of supplemental melatonin. as melatonin is classed as a supplement in the united states, it is not regulated by the food and drug administration (fda). it is best to speak to your doctor before using any type of melatonin, patch or otherwise. sometimes, melatonin patches contain other sleep-promoting ingredients in addition to melatonin, such as valerian, l-theanine, or gaba. they may also contain adhesives, or ingredients designed to facilitate the absorption of these sleep aids.
what can resulting sleep deprivation lead to?	what does it mean if you experience hypnic jerks	trouble sleeping and lack of regular sleep overall, whether due to chronic insomnia or a poor night's sleep, can both lead to sleep deprivation. among other unwanted side effects, like poor mood and focus, sleep deprivation may increase your risk of hypnic jerks. both everyday stress and diagnosed anxiety disorders can contribute to insomnia, which leads to the kind of sleep deprivation that increases your risk of hypnic jerks. when you're stressed or anxious, your cortisol levels remain elevated during sleep, which makes your sleep less restful. anxious thoughts can also keep you up at night, making it hard for you to relax into sleep and disrupting the transition between wakefulness and sleep, potentially triggering a hypnic jerk.

who are latex toppers suitable for?	mattress pad vs. mattress topper	because they tend to isolate motion well, many couples opt for memory foam toppers in order to reduce sleep disturbances. latex toppers are suitable for sleepers who want extra contouring without too much sink. latex offers ample pressure relief while still providing enough bounce to facilitate movement. sleepers looking to increase their mattress' firmness level might want to consider a dunlop latex topper, as this type is typically denser. talalay latex, on the other hand, is usually more breathable, making it a better topper choice for people who sleep hot. while not as common as other types, wool mattress toppers are sought out for their softness and breathability.
how much time do sleepers spend in stage 2?	stages of sleep: rem and nrem sleep cycles	during this brief stage of sleep, brain waves begin to shift from their waking pattern while breathing and heartbeat slow and muscles begin to relax. occasional muscle twitches are a normal part of this sleep stage, and the eyes may move slowly behind the eyelids. stage 2 sleep is deeper than the first sleep stage, but sleep is still light enough for a person to be woken up easily. sleepers spend around 45% to 55% of their sleep time in stage 2, more than any other stage of sleep. stage 2 sleep is relatively short during the first sleep cycle of the night, lasting just 10 to 25 minutes, but gets longer as the night progresses.

what are sleep attacks?	reasons for waking up gasping for air	sleep paralysis is believed to arise when the brain partially wakes up but retains the muscle paralysis that occurs during dreams. some people with sleep paralysis report hallucinations of a presence in the room or someone sitting on their chest. nocturnal panic attacks can cause people to wake up with shortness of breath, choking, or feelings of being smothered. these may be accompanied by other panic attack symptoms such as a pounding heart, sweating, tingling sensations, or feelings of unreality or not being yourself. people may experience panic attacks only at night, or during the day as well.
what do pink noise contain?	what is white noise	because white noise spans multiple bands of sound, it is sometimes referred to as a broadband noise. anecdotally, people often liken white noise to the static that comes from an untuned radio or television. researchers have studied the effect of white noise on humans for many years, finding evidence it can reduce crying in infants, improve work performance, and potentially help counteract symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd). multiple studies have also examined how white noise may affect human sleep. like white noise, pink noise is a broadband sound containing components from across the sound spectrum.
what can melatonin potentially help treat?	what is melatonin	although melatonin supplements are not approved as a sleep aid by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda), research suggests melatonin may improve sleep for some people. researchers continue to study the effect of melatonin supplementation for other disorders, such as cancer, heart problems, digestive disorders, and mental illnesses. researchers have had some success in using melatonin supplements to treat sleep problems in children, particularly children with accompanying conditions such as autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd), or eczema. studies show taking melatonin before bed may help these children fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer, though more research is needed.
what should you do if you experience certain health conditions?	sleep benefits of going to a chiropractor	lastly, people with broken bones and chronic arthritis are not encouraged to seek chiropractic care, because arthritis can cause joint immobility and bone erosion. check with your primary care physician prior to receiving treatment to determine if you're a good candidate for chiropractic care. in addition to seeing a chiropractor, you can also address your lack of slumber in a variety of ways.

how do you ensure there is time for your core body temperature to return to levels that are favorable for sleep?	tips for creating a bedtime routine	a relaxing sleep environment is crucial for maintaining a healthy bedtime routine. there are a few measures you can take to optimize your bedroom for sleep. your body temperature drops as part of your normal sleep cycle. although some people may be inclined to raise the temperature of their bedroom or bundle up with cozy blankets to stay warm, studies have shown that an overly hot bedroom environment can interfere with sleep and cause fatigue the next day. setting the thermostat a few degrees cooler generally promotes better sleep. taking a warm shower or bath before bed can also help you relax by promoting a natural cool-down effect afterward.
what is involved in the processes of producing hormones and chemicals hat regulate sleep and wakefulness?	how sleep works: understanding the science of sleep	even after decades of research, the exact reason why we sleep remains one of the most enduring and intriguing mysteries in health science. to try to get to the bottom of this question, experts analyze how sleep works and what happens when we don't get enough sleep. studies demonstrate that sleep is incredibly complex and has effects on virtually all systems of the body. multiple parts of the brain are involved in the processes of producing hormones and chemicals that regulate sleep and wakefulness. while there is much that is still to be learned about the intricacies of how sleep works, existing research sheds light on the mechanics of what happens in the brain and body during sleep.
how much time is should be spent in deep sleep?	pink noise: can it help you sleep	not only did this system help participants fall asleep faster, but it also helped them reach deep sleep earlier. multiple studies have examined how pink noise may be used to enhance sleep quality. one study found that participants' brain waves gradually slowed in synchrony with a pink noise soundtrack, helping stabilize their sleep. researchers have also succeeded at enhancing deep sleep by playing quiet bursts of pink noise at strategic times during the night. deep sleep is the most restorative sleep stage and it plays a prominent role in immune system functioning. pink noise enhancement of deep sleep may also have favorable effects for stress hormone levels and cardiovascular health.
how long are the adjustments you should make when you gradually adjust to a new sleep schedule?	how to reset your sleep routine	a key first step is to reset your sleep schedule. pick a bedtime and wake-up time that you can stick with and that offer ample time for the sleep you need. follow this schedule every day, even on weekends. at first, you may find it hard to adjust to this new sleep schedule, and that's normal. a new routine won't feel normal immediately; it takes time to get used to. in order to gradually adjust to a new sleep schedule, you can make adjustments in 15 or 30 minute increments over a series of days.
when do you first experience your rem sleep?	rem sleep behavior disorder	when a person is having an episode, they can usually be awoken relatively easily. when they wake up, they are usually alert, coherent, and can recall the content of the dream. rem sleep usually begins about 90 minutes after you fall asleep, and rem sleep stages get longer in the second half of the night. for that reason, episodes of rem sleep behavior disorder frequently arise later in a sleep period. episodes can occur once or multiple times during the night. people may experience them a few times per year or every night. rem sleep behavior disorder can develop suddenly or gradually, but symptoms typically worsen over time.
what is the average reaction time of a human?	can sleep deprivation affect reaction time	reaction time is defined as the amount of time it takes to respond to a stimulus, which can be any event that comes before a response. the human brain is immensely complex, and the typical time it takes for a physical response to a stimulus is around 160 to 190 milliseconds - or a little less than 0.2 seconds. that's around the same time it takes to blink. while our physical reactions can happen in a blink of an eye, behind the scenes our brain is working through a series of processes. for example, before responding to a baseball being thrown by a pitcher, a catcher's brain must recognize the ball, decide to respond, then send a message down the spinal cord to their hands and fingers.
what can a sleep diary help healthcare providers with?	how to wake up early	they can verify there are no underlying health concerns causing you to sleep in longer than you desire. if possible, keep a sleep diary and record your sleep and wake habits leading up to your doctor's visit. it may be helpful to include how refreshed and alert you felt after waking. your diary can help your healthcare provider see a bigger picture of your sleep. together, you and your doctor can determine the reason you wake up late and develop a plan for helping you wake up earlier.
what are the benefits of sleeping on the left side?	sleeping in the fetal position	pregnant people, those who have obstructive sleep apnea, and people experiencing back pain may enjoy the greatest benefits from side sleeping. sleeping in the fetal position may be a great option for people who are pregnant, especially in the later stages of pregnancy. sleeping on your back while pregnant can put unnecessary pressure on your back and cardiac system. the fetal position, in which you are sleeping on your side with your knees bent, can reduce pressure on your heart during pregnancy. experts specifically recommend sleeping on your left side while pregnant. specialized pregnancy pillows can help support your back and legs during sleep so you can more comfortably sleep on your side.
what is part of a healthy sleep hygiene?	what is sexsomnia	counseling, both for the person with sexsomnia and any others who are affected, can help with the emotional toll this disorder can pose. as sexsomnia treatment may not be immediately effective, it is crucial to take safety precautions as necessary. it is crucial to have good sleep hygiene, which has been shown to help people with parasomnias. following a sleep schedule, winding down at the end of the day, and keeping a consistent bedtime routine are all part of healthy sleep hygiene.
what should you do if you are experiencing sleep problems or daytime symptoms such as excessive tiredness?	how to get more rem sleep	sleep hygiene may be helpful for some people, but it is not considered sufficient treatment for people who have a diagnosed sleep disorder (such as insomnia) or other medical condition. make an appointment with a medical professional if you are experiencing sleep problems or daytime symptoms such as excessive tiredness. consider keeping a sleep diary in the days leading up to your visit to provide a clearer picture of your symptoms. sleep issues may be due to an undiagnosed medical condition or sleep disorder, which your doctor can help you treat. the body has ways of recuperating the lost rem sleep once the underlying condition is resolved, but it is important to address sleep problems once you notice them to prevent long-term health complications.
when is it time to find a replacement mattress?	how long should a mattress last	some mattresses can be flipped or rotated regularly, but be sure to check the manufacturer's recommendations. the table below summarizes performance and durability ratings for the most popular mattress types. knowing how long a mattress should last is useful, though ultimately, these are just guidelines. figuring out when it's time to replace your mattress is a personal decision that involves several factors. if you can answer yes to one or more of these questions, it may be time to replace your mattress. if you're still sleeping soundly, and your mattress appears to be performing well, then perhaps you can squeeze a few more years out of it.

what effect does sharing your bed with pets have on the lifespan of a mattress?	sleeping with pets: benefits and risks	people with animal companions often enjoy their pet's company so much that they like to share the bed with them at night. with small animals like gerbils and chinchillas that like to nibble on things, might run away, and are not easily potty trained, sleeping together may not be a good idea. with larger animals, the question of whether to share a bed or not is less clear-cut. research shows 56% of people report sleeping with a pet in their bedroom, and nearly 35% of children share their bed with a pet at night. co-sleeping may even be preferred by your pet, with over 86% of puppies choosing to sleep near a human when they have the opportunity.
what systems does osa involve?	the connection between sleep apnea and teeth grinding (or bruxism)	given this inconsistency, a separate mechanism may influence the development of osa and sleep-related bruxism and make them more likely to co-occur. early research has identified abnormalities in pathways of dopamine and serotonin, chemicals of the nervous system known as neurotransmitters, as one possible underlying mechanism. according to some expert opinions, there is a multifaceted and complex relationship between sleep apnea and teeth grinding that can manifest in distinct ways in different individuals. osa is a complicated disorder that involves the nervous, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems. it can be tied to both genetic and environmental factors as well as a person's weight, anatomy in the head-and-neck region, sleeping position, among other influences.
what are circadian rhythm sleep disorder characterized by?	understanding sleep studies for seniors	by tracking sleep stages and monitoring physical movements in bed, a sleep study is an essential test to conclusively determine if a person has rem sleep behavior disorder. circadian rhythm sleep disorders involve disruptions to the body's internal clock that helps regulate a person's sleep schedule. in older adults, this can involve going to bed much earlier and having difficulty sleeping through the night. circadian rhythm disruptions can contribute to irregular sleep times that interfere with consistent rest. people with circadian rhythm sleep disorders often do not need a sleep study. however, these disorders can occur at the same time as other conditions, so testing may be used to identify another sleep disorder affecting daily sleep patterns.
how often should you rotate your mattress from head to foot?	should you flip or rotate your mattress	to find out how often you should rotate your mattress, check your owner's manual. however often you choose to rotate your mattress, try to keep it consistent. the idea behind rotating mattresses regularly is to switch around the areas where your body lays on the mattress, thereby spreading out the pressure points that may be subject to sagging. by rotating on a consistent schedule, you can minimize the risk of premature sagging in specific areas. keep in mind that some mattresses should not be rotated. this mostly applies to mattresses with a zoned comfort system.
what happens to memory foam when coming into contact with body heat and pressure?	mattress comfort layers	some comfort systems are made entirely of memory foam, while others also add layers of polyfoam, latex, or minicoils. memory foam softens in the presence of heat, giving it its characteristic body-hugging sensation and allowing it to cradle pressure points around the shoulders, hips, and lower back. memory foam cools and returns to its original form when the sleeper leaves the bed. in addition to providing pressure relief, memory foam also absorbs movement and noise well, making it an excellent choice for couples. a possible disadvantage of memory foam's deep contouring is that movement may feel restricted.
how do you encourage your body to cycle naturally through the sleep stages and optimize your metabolism while sleeping?	how to build a better bedtime routine for adults	ready to dream up your ideal bedtime routine? try these ten ideas. as part of your natural sleep-wake cycle, your brain starts winding down for sleep a few hours before bedtime. you can use your bedtime routine to make that process more effective. first, decide on your bed- and wake-up times, and stick to them every day. following a consistent sleep routine helps train your brain to naturally feel tired when it's bedtime. next, schedule a time to begin your bedtime routine every night, anywhere between 30 minutes to 2 hours before bed. set an alarm if you need to.

when does chronic insomnia occur?	stress and insomnia	it occurs despite adequate time allotted for sleep on a given night and a comfortable place to sleep, and people with insomnia experience excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue, irritability and other impairments when they are awake. current estimates suggest 10-30% of adults live with insomnia. a person may be diagnosed with chronic insomnia if their symptoms occur at least three times per week for at least three months. persistent stressors can heavily contribute to chronic insomnia. not everyone develops chronic insomnia due to constant stress, but those with anxiety disorder are at higher risk of experiencing insomnia symptoms.
what two symptoms used to diagnose ptsd are related to sleep?	how post-traumatic stress disorder affects sleep	post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) is characterized by a chronically heightened state of arousal after a traumatic event. ptsd often gets worse over time or develops insidiously, so that people may not realize they have it until many months after the traumatic event. the disease is more common in women, though it can happen to anybody. an estimated seven people out of 100 will experience ptsd during their lifetime. ptsd and sleep have a complex relationship. though sleep problems accompany many mental health conditions, sleep problems in ptsd are actually considered part of the disorder. among the symptoms used to diagnose ptsd, two are directly related to sleep: hyperarousal and intrusion, which can manifest as insomnia and nightmares.
what do circadian rhythm sleep disorders involve?	how sleep deprivation affects your heart	circadian rhythm sleep disorders, which occur when a person's internal clock is misaligned with day and night, have been associated with cardiovascular problems. for example, people who work night shifts and have to sleep during the day have heightened risks of hypertension, obesity, and diabetes as well as cardiac events like a stroke or heart attack. pregnancy places additional strain on the heart and some women develop cardiovascular problems during pregnancy. high blood pressure, for example, can begin or worsen during pregnancy with potential complications for both the mother and her baby. insomnia, sleep apnea, and other sleep difficulties affect many pregnant women, and these issues have been associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular problems both during and after pregnancy.
how long are king mattresses?	mattress glossary	the alberta king is a foot shorter on each side than the alaskan king. california king: the longest of the standard mattress sizes, measuring 72 inches wide by 84 inches long. although the california king is 4 inches longer than a regular king, it's also 4 inches narrower. california queen: a non-standard mattress size that typically measures 60 inches wide by 84 inches long. the california queen is 4 inches longer than a standard queen. family: an extra-wide rectangular mattress that usually measures either 144 inches by 80 inches or 120 inches by 80 inches.
how much money spent on electricity goes to lighting households after dark?	ending daylight saving time: how would it change sleep	so why was daylight saving time put in place at all? part of it was commerce, with some lobbying groups arguing that it led to more shopping and sports-watching. a leading initial rationale for daylight saving time was to reduce energy consumption by decreasing the need to have lights on in the evening. still, changes in how we use electricity today may have reduced the energy savings from dst. about 6% of the money spent on electricity goes to lighting households after dark. in 2006, the department of energy called the energy savings relatively small, with the national bureau of economic research finding that these were offset by added heating and cooling costs.
what stage of sleep is most affected after trauma?	the role of trauma in sleep problems	sleep issues are common after a traumatic experience. alertness and hyperarousal related to the effects of the body's stress response often contribute to the symptoms of insomnia. many people have difficulty falling asleep, wake up more often during the night, and have trouble falling back asleep after a traumatic event. trauma can also affect sleep architecture, which means that it can change how the body moves through sleep cycles and stages. although experts are still working to understand the implications of the changes observed in sleep architecture after trauma, rapid eye movement (rem) sleep appears to be the stage most affected.
how does disrupted sleep affect dementia?	aging and sleep	unlike some of the normal signs of aging like slower memory recall and thought processing, dementia is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive loss of brain cells and cognitive functioning that interferes with a person's ability to care for themself. there are different stages and types of dementia, with alzheimer's disease being the most common. people with dementia frequently experience sleep disturbances. this can occur as a result of dementia's effects on the brain, and people with dementia are also more likely to have certain sleep disorders like obstructive sleep apnea, irregular circadian rhythms, insomnia, and rem sleep behavior disorder.
how does a healthier diet affect sleep?	the connection between diet, exercise, and sleep	eating a healthy, balanced diet has been shown to reduce the risk of a myriad of health conditions, from heart disease and stroke, to diabetes and obesity. diet can also affect our mental health, with several studies suggesting that certain diets may reduce the risk of developing depression and anxiety. food can either fuel or foil a workout, and research shows that combining a healthy diet with adequate exercise offers more benefits than improving diet alone. the right combination of fluids, carbohydrates and protein, eaten at the right time, can improve athletic performance and decrease fatigue. poor dietary choices, like eating right before a high-intensity cardio workout, can lead to increased nausea and make exercise more challenging.
what should be the total amount of time spent sleeping daily for toddlers to be well-rested?	how much sleep do children need	children 2 years and older need less daily sleep than newborns and infants, but getting the right amount of sleep is still crucial for proper health, growth, and cognitive development. sleep recommendations for kids largely depend on their age group. children in the age range of 1 to 2 years should sleep 11 to 14 hours for every 24-hour period. this includes nightly sleep as well as daytime naps, which are integral to cognitive functioning and memory development. the average toddler naps twice per day, but the duration of these naps gradually decreases over time. by the time they reach 2 years old, toddlers typically nap no longer than one hour at a time.
what are beds made of latex also known for?	pressure relief	high-density polyfoam support cores help prevent sleepers from sinking too far into the mattress. some softer all-foam models fail to adequately support sleepers over 230 pounds, which may lead to excessive sinkage in weight-bearing areas with corresponding pressure buildup. latex mattresses tend to be durable and supportive. although they don't offer localized contouring, they can help reduce potential pressure points from improper spinal alignment by limiting sinkage. made with thick comfort systems over coil support cores, hybrid mattresses aim to leverage the advantages of multiple types of beds. hybrids usually provide average to above-average pressure relief depending on the composition of the comfort system.
how can you decrease pressure on your spine?	waking up with back pain: causes and tips for relief	make sure that your elbows are directly beneath your shoulders and your forearms and elbows are in line with your wrists. keep your head facing down, with your neck in alignment with the rest of your spine. it is important to keep your spine straight, without letting your abdomen sink too far down or up. you can prevent straining your back by squeezing your abs, your glutes, and your thighs. for best results, hold this pose for 30 to 60 seconds. research shows that yoga can help manage recurring lower back pain. when you are experiencing lower back pain, a baby cobra pose can help stretch your back and relieve tension.

what antidepressants are known to cause drowsiness for some people?	epilepsy and sleep: challenges and solutions	antiepileptic drugs can affect sleep, although it's often difficult to determine if sleep issues are due to medications or to the physical and social effects of having epilepsy. side effects of these medications can vary from patient to patient. some medications may cause people to feel drowsy, while others may cause them to feel more alert. doctors may use the potential effects of antiepileptic drugs to benefit patients with sleep issues. for example, doctors may prescribe nighttime use of antiepileptic drugs that cause drowsiness in patients with insomnia. they may prescribe daytime use of antiepileptic drugs with stimulating effects for patients with daytime drowsiness.
what is the cause of sagging?	signs and effects of a bad mattress	if you no longer wake up feeling refreshed, your mattress may be at the end of its life. other signs that your mattress is affecting your sleep include waking up multiple times a night or taking longer than usual to fall asleep. sagging: almost all mattresses start to sag over time as a result of supporting the weight of your body night after night. a sagging mattress can lead to uneven spinal support, which may cause pressure to build up in your back and neck as you sleep. seeing permanent body indentations in the mattress is a clear sign that it needs replacing.
what is the most common treatment for sleep apnea in adults?	apap vs. cpap	this allows it to meet changing pressure needs throughout the night. a cpap machine is adjusted to one setting, usually during a pap titration study at home or in a sleep study center, or by trial and error while using the machine. if the pressure is too high and causes exhalation discomfort, the cpap can be manually adjusted to a new setting, but it will not adjust automatically. understanding the differences between these two machines can help sleep apnea sufferers work with a medical professional to find the right fit. cpap machines are the most commonly prescribed treatment for sleep apnea, and have been in use since the 1980s.
what does sleep affect?	does lack of sleep cause acne	sleep can also affect mood and perception, including how a person perceives their skin and overall appearance. women who sleep well tend to be more satisfied with their appearance than women who do not sleep well. this satisfaction may be due in part to how they are perceived in the world. studies have demonstrated that someone who is sleep deprived is perceived as less attractive. as a result of sleep deprivation, they might have dark circles under their eyes, swollen eyelids, and a puffy face. there is also a correlation between appearing tired and appearing sad.
what does resistance exercise focus on?	the best aerobic exercises to get better sleep	however, some studies have noted that moderate or vigorous workouts before bed have little to no effect on sleep onset or sleep quality. resistance exercise, also known as strength training, focuses on building muscle strength throughout the body. health experts recommend a mix of aerobic and resistance exercise in order to improve different aspects of your physiological health. the key to effective strength training is repetition. you should perform sets of resistance exercises that include up to 12 repetitions apiece. strength training can initially be very difficult, so first-timers may begin with one set of each activity per workout and gradually increase to multiple sets once they are comfortable.
what should you do when considering alternative treatments for menopause?	night sweats: causes & treatments	if menopause is the most likely cause of your night sweats, discussing the risks and benefits of hormone replacement therapy with your doctor can help you decide whether this is the right option for you. doctors may also prescribe non-hormonal treatments for menopause symptoms, such as certain antidepressants. on the other hand, if antidepressants are causing night sweats, doctors may prescribe additional drugs to minimize the unwanted side effects. for example, other drugs may help relieve sweating caused by methadone. some people consider using holistic approaches as remedies for night sweats. however, in some cases, more research is needed to clarify how helpful or effective these methods are in treating excessive nighttime sweating.
what are the most common firmness levels for pillows?	mattress construction	additionally, pillow-tops and euro-tops - layers of padding sewn into the top of the mattress - can also cushion the surface. some models have removable, washable covers. however, for most mattresses, the cover should never be removed and should only be spot cleaned as needed if stains occur. the components of a mattress contribute to its firmness or feel. firmness is measured on a scale of 1 through 10, with 1 being the softest and 10 being the firmest, but most mattresses fall between 3 (soft) and 8 (firm). the most common firmness levels are medium and medium firm because they provide a balance of contouring and support that caters to sleepers of average weight (130 to 230 pounds).
what creates a friendlier environment for bacteria on the back of the contact lens?	can you sleep with contacts in	poor contact lens hygiene, including swimming or showering while wearing your contact lenses, increases your risk. this type of infection can develop if you have a scrape in your eye, which may happen from either an injury or regular contact lens wear, and the organism enters the scrape via water or contact lens solution. sleeping in your lenses overnight can make you more susceptible to an ancanthamoeba keratitis infection. wearing contacts reduces the amount of oxygen to your cornea, which impairs your cornea's ability to protect itself from microorganisms. fungal keratitis, or corneal inflammation caused by a fungal infection, can also lead to vision loss or blindness when left untreated.
what is the circadian pacemaker strongly influenced by?	what is circadian rhythm	for this reason, circadian rhythms are closely connected to day and night. while other cues, like exercise, social activity, and temperature, can affect the master clock, light is the most powerful influence on circadian rhythms. biological clocks help regulate the timing of bodily processes, including circadian rhythms. a circadian rhythm is an effect of a biological clock, but not all biological clocks are circadian. for instance, plants adjust to changing seasons using a biological clock with timing that is distinct from a 24-hour cycle. when people talk about circadian rhythm, it's most often in the context of sleep.
what problems might children with misaligned teeth encounter?	micrognathia: what it is and how it causes sleep apnea	in a study of adolescents and young adults with micrognathia, cpap therapy significantly reduced sleep apnea symptoms. cpap therapy is intended to be temporary, and is less effective when used in a person where the airway is physically blocked by enlarged tissues. in these cases, cpap therapy may reveal the need for corrective surgery instead. doctors may recommend various types of oral surgery to clear the airways, depending on the severity and the cause of a person's micrognathia. misalignment of the teeth may be treated with orthodontic braces or oral surgery. tongue-lip adhesion can move the base of the tongue forward, while mandibular distraction osteogenesis (mdo) surgery gradually extends the lower jaw by adding or removing bone.
how is fiber staple length related to softness?	bamboo vs. cotton sheets	made from fabric derived from cotton plants, cotton sheets are airy and soft. there are three types of cotton used to make sheets: pima, egyptian, and upland. staple length is an important factor to consider when choosing between cotton varieties, and it's one of the greatest differences between the three types. staple length refers to a fiber's average length. generally, the longer a fiber's staple length, the softer it feels and the more durable it is. when spun into thread, short-staple fibers aren't totally smooth, which makes the fabric feel a bit rougher than fabric made from long-staple fiber.
what drugs can suppress rem sleep?	rem sleep: what it is and why it matters	since you get most of your rem sleep in the second half of the night, short sleepers spend less time in rem. certain medications, such as those commonly used to treat anxiety and depression, may also suppress rem sleep. certain sleep disorders are associated with abnormal rem sleep. if you notice symptoms of sleep deprivation, or believe you might have a sleep disorder like rem sleep behavior disorder or nightmare disorder, talk to your doctor. they can help you determine the cause of your sleep issues and develop a treatment strategy to improve your sleep.
what is stomach sleeping a considerable risk factor for?	when can babies start sleeping on their stomachs	this recommendation applies to all types of sleeping, including daytime naps. after a child turns 1 year old, there is no need to make sure they sleep only on their back. while stomach sleeping is not advised for most infants, there may be some children for whom the risks of sleeping on their stomach are outweighed by the benefits. caregivers should discuss questions or concerns about sleeping position with their child's pediatrician. stomach sleeping is a considerable risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome (sids). the term is applied to events when an apparently healthy infant unexpectedly dies, usually during sleep.
what do lucid dreams originate from?	lucid dreams: definition, techniques, and benefits	rem sleep constitutes the fourth and final stage of a normal sleep cycle; the first three stages consist of non-rapid eye movement (nrem) sleep. the general consensus among researchers today is that lucid dreams originate from non-lucid dreams during the rem sleep stage. in this sense, lucidity is an aspect of dreams that can be triggered using different means. spontaneous lucid dreams are rare and difficult to foresee. to study these phenomena, researchers typically induce lucid dreams using different methods. additionally, some studies have involved inducing lucid dreams using certain types of drugs and supplements.
how many adults get less than 7 hours of sleep each night?	natural sleep aids: which ones are safe	around one-third of american adults sleep less than seven hours per night, and many of them use medications and sleep aids to try to get the sleep they need. in recent years, more people have turned their attention to natural sleep aids with an estimated 20% of adults having tried a natural sleep remedy in the last year. sold over-the-counter or online, natural sleep aids don't go through the same testing and review process as prescription medicines, leading many people to wonder whether natural sleep aids are safe and which ones might be worth taking. in general, there's a lack of high-quality research about the effectiveness and safety of most natural sleep aids.
how many people experience more recurrent or bothersome episodes that make sleep paralysis especially distressing?	what is a false awakening	a person experiencing sleep paralysis is mentally awake, however, while a person experiencing a false awakening wrongly believes they have just woken up, although they are still dreaming. sleep paralysis is more likely to occur in people with poor sleep quality, insomnia symptoms, or significant stress. researchers have proposed that one way to reduce sleep paralysis may be to teach people how to gain control of their dreams, as sometimes occurs in lucid dreaming. during a lucid dream, the sleeper remains asleep but gains awareness that they are in a dream. people with frequent lucid dreams also tend to experience higher-than-usual rates of false awakenings.
what certifications should you look for to certify the origins of egyptian cotton?	bamboo vs. cotton sheets	luxury cotton sheets have long- or extra-long staple lengths that make the fabric both soft and durable. before considering luxury cotton sheet weaves or thread count, look for certifications to ensure the manufacturer's claims are accurate. many sets are labeled egyptian even if they only contain a small percentage of egyptian cotton. look for certifications from the egyptian cotton association, which dna tests cotton to certify its origins. in the case of pima cotton, check the percentage of pima cotton within the fabric or research where the cotton was grown. once cotton fiber is spun into thread, manufacturers use many different weaving methods to achieve different feels.
what does the amount of water you need to drink each day depend on?	how drinking water before bed impacts sleep	it is not uncommon to feel thirsty right before going to bed. in fact, a study in mice showed that the tendency to drink more in the evening might be a natural part of the sleep-wake cycle, in order to prevent becoming dehydrated overnight. although mild dehydration does not appear to directly impact sleep for otherwise healthy people, staying hydrated supports systems in the body that do impact your sleep. water is an essential nutrient for the human body, helping to remove waste, lubricate the joints, regulate body temperature, and cushion sensitive tissues. although recommendations vary, the general consensus is that adults should drink between 2.5 and 4.5 liters of water a day depending on their body weight and level of activity.
what types of nuts contain high levels of melatonin?	foods and drinks that make you tired	pistachios and walnuts both contain high concentrations of melatonin. consuming these nuts can boost your blood melatonin levels, with potential benefits for sleep. other foods that also contain relatively high levels of melatonin include grapes, strawberries, tomatoes, peppers, and germinated soybean seeds. more research is needed to determine how these foods impact sleep. the first scientific studies regarding specific foods that improve sleep focused on horlicks, a brand of malted milk drink. these studies found that people who consumed a glass of warm milk with horlicks powder 30 minutes before bedtime slept more soundly, and older adults in these studies also slept longer.
what are the benefits of morning bright light therapy?	what treatments are available for shift work disorder	specifically, bright light boosts alertness and suppresses the release of the sleep hormone, melatonin. exposure to bright light can keep you awake and delay when you start to feel sleepy. using a bright light box before work or turning up the lights during a night shift may help you feel more awake. during periods when you are switching from one type of shift to another, applying bright light therapy in the morning may help you shift your circadian rhythm so you wake up and fall asleep earlier. applying bright light therapy in the evening can shift your circadian rhythm later, helping you adjust to an upcoming night shift.
what is the purpose of the transitional layer?	mattress support cores	the type of materials used in the comfort system directly relates to how firm the mattress will feel. the comfort layers should conform closely enough to relieve pressure points, without causing users to sink in too far and feel swallowed by the mattress. transitional layers are typically made of slightly firmer materials than the comfort system, such as high-density polyfoam, latex, or microcoils. the goal of a transitional layer is to provide a deeper cradle and prevent sleepers from making contact with the hard support core. this layer is usually thinner, between 1 and 3 inches.
how long can a latex pillow last?	how often should you replace your pillow	most pillows last 1 to 2 years before they need to be replaced, but different types of pillows can have different lifespans. we'll cover a few steps you can take to proactively increase the lifespan of any type of pillow. it's also important to keep an eye out for signs of wear and tear so you can replace your pillow when needed. the average pillow should last around 1 to 2 years, but there are several ways to lengthen its lifespan. our tips focus on keeping your pillow clean to prevent premature breakdown of the inner fill material.
what is insomnia?	treatments for insomnia	insomnia is a disorder characterized by persistent difficulty with sleep onset, maintenance, consolidation, or quality. people who have insomnia struggle with sleep despite adequate opportunities for sleep, and also experience excessive daytime sleepiness and other dysfunctions when they are awake. based on various studies and surveys, today's sleep experts estimate 10% to 30% of adults live with some form of insomnia. treating insomnia typically involves sleep-inducing medication, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (cbt-i), or a combination of both of these measures. positive lifestyle changes may alleviate symptoms for some people, as well. there is no best treatment for insomnia. specific treatment recommendations depend on whether the patient has short-term or chronic insomnia, as well as their medical history.
what are the two types of sleep?	do fish sleep	depending on the species, researchers believe they may either swim slowly within a confined perimeter, sleep in currents, keep their fins moving, or sleep with only part of their brain to keep breathing while they sleep. mammals show a clear distinction between rem and slow wave sleep. although research so far is limited, studies on zebrafish suggest they experience two markedly different sleep stages that alternate back and forth. the first is characterized by regular pulses of nervous system activity, similar to slow wave sleep in mammals. the other is more similar to rem sleep. researchers have yet to determine if fish experience true rem sleep.
when do toddlers need to start sleeping longer at night?	when do kids stop taking naps	as you eliminate napping, your child should start sleeping longer at night. toddlers need between 11 and 14 hours of sleep, while preschoolers need 10 to 13 hours of sleep per 24-hour period. once they're no longer napping, you'll have to move their bedtime earlier so they don't go short on sleep. keeping a consistent bedtime routine and being proactive about sleep hygiene can help your toddler adjust to their new schedule. the end of naptime is a sad day for many parents, but it marks an exciting step on the way to becoming a big kid. another perk of embarking on this new phase is that falling asleep at bedtime may become easier for a child who doesn't nap, and this can lead to a better sleep for everyone in the household.
what is a popular substitute for memory foam?	is memory foam toxic	individuals who wish to avoid memory foam can find plenty of natural alternatives. a popular substitute is natural latex, a material derived from the sap of rubber trees that is breathable, durable, and more bouncy than memory foam. more rarely, some hybrid beds may combine an innerspring core with naturally derived comfort layers made of wool, cotton batting, or feathers.

what does the 4-7-8 method involve?	sleep training: definition & techniques	the ferber method is similar to cry it out, but more gradual, hence its nicknames of graduated extinction, progressive waiting, and the interval method. with this method, parents follow the same routine of taking their baby through a bedtime ritual, cuddling them and kissing them goodnight, and then leaving the room and shutting the door. for the first few nights, the parents immediately return whenever the baby cries, patting them and ensuring they're calm before leaving the room again. after the first few nights, parents gradually increase the amount of time they let the baby cry before reentering the room, eventually reaching a point where the baby self-soothes.
what are the majority of eye infections are caused by?	can you sleep with contacts in	eye infections from contact lenses are estimated to happen in fewer than 2 out of each 1,000 contact wearers, though the rate is much higher for those who sleep in contacts. keratitis is the medical term for an inflamed cornea, the part of your eye that sits against the contact lens. a common type of keratitis that affects people who wear contact lenses is microbial keratitis, which can be caused by bacteria, fungi, parasites, or other microorganisms. the majority of contact lens-provoked eye infections are caused by bacteria called pseudomonas aeruginosa. to treat microbial keratitis, your doctor may prescribe antibiotic eye drops.
what is maintaining a regular bedtime associated with?	healthy sleep: what is it and are you getting it	researchers who shifted the typical sleep schedule in mice found that even though the mice retained their usual sleep duration, their sleep quality suffered. in people, maintaining a regular bedtime is associated with a reduced risk for adverse health effects such as obesity and diabetes. in addition to evaluating your nightly experience of sleep in terms of duration, continuity, and timing, there are numerous short-term and long-term benefits to healthy sleep. on the other hand, a sleep pattern that isn't healthy comes with characteristic indicators as well. if one or more of these signs sounds like you, start by examining your sleep hygiene practices to see whether you can promote better sleep by changing your environment, adjusting your daily activities, and establishing a bedtime routine.
what are depression and seasonal affective disorder (sad) strongly associated with?	what are sleep spindles	psychiatric disorders: sleep spindle disturbances and reduced spindle activity are associated with psychiatric symptoms. these changes have been found in people with both anxiety disorders and schizophrenia. in schizophrenia, reduced spindle activity is believed to have a genetic component, and it may explain difficulties with memory and learning. studies of children and adolescents with social anxiety disorder have found that heightened reactivity to negative stimuli goes hand-in-hand with reduced fast sleep spindles. reduced sleep spindle activity is associated with early-onset depression. people who experience a stroke may have reduced sleep spindle activity. whether or not a person who had a stroke experiences this sleep change depends on the type and location of the damage.
how do sleep problems in ptsd slow down the recovery process?	how post-traumatic stress disorder affects sleep	once the disorder sets in, the presence of sleep problems appears to exacerbate ptsd symptoms. and even after treating daytime ptsd symptoms, many people find that insomnia still persists. sleep problems in ptsd interfere with the brain's ability to process memories and emotions, slowing down the recovery process after a traumatic event. moreover, many people with ptsd use alcohol or other substances to try to sleep better. far from helping, these counterproductive coping mechanisms actually worsen sleep and can aggravate ptsd symptoms as well. individuals with ptsd frequently have trouble falling asleep and awaken easily, often waking up many times throughout the night.

how many americans have tried a natural sleep aid in the past 12 months?	natural sleep aids: a competitive review of melatonin, valerian, and others	however, since the fda does not review if supplements are safe or effective, finding the most effective natural sleep aid can be difficult. learning about the evidence supporting different supplements, as well as their potential effects and side effects, can make it easier to decide which natural sleep aid might be best for you. however, it is important to consult your doctor before starting any new supplement. natural does not always mean safe for everyone. many supplements should not be taken by people who are allergic to the product, have certain conditions, or take certain drugs.
what might be the issue if your air mattress isn't staying inflated?	how to fix a hole in an air mattress	if your air mattress isn't staying inflated, a hole could be the culprit. while it's normal for inflatable air mattresses to lose air over time, even a tiny tear can quickly reduce volume. less inflation means weaker support, so it's best to address the root cause as soon as possible. sharp objects or other accidents can cause air leaks, but sometimes a manufacturing defect is to blame. if you don't think the hole is related to normal use, check the user manual before fixing the tear yourself. holes and other damage are sometimes covered under the manufacturer's warranty.
what can contribute to nighttime heat and humidity levels?	why do you get hot when you sleep	the clothes you wear to bed, along with your bedding, also contribute to your nighttime heat and humidity levels. sweating helps your body avoid becoming too hot, so you want to avoid fabrics that interfere with your ability to sweat. certain health conditions can also affect your body's ability to regulate temperature, leading to hot sleep. these include sleep disorders, like obstructive sleep apnea. also, people who have depression don't experience as much of the decrease in core body temperature that's supposed to occur before sleep and tend to sweat more at night. night sweats in particular have been linked to a number of conditions, including gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd), diabetes, and obesity.
when may short-term insomnia symptoms begin to dissipate?	stress and insomnia	for example, new parents may experience insomnia symptoms when sharing their bedroom with their baby for the first time, even if the child is not audibly disruptive. children may also have sleep problems immediately after they begin sharing their room with a sibling. visiting or moving to a new location can lead to short-term insomnia, as well. short-term insomnia symptoms may begin to dissipate once the stressful situation ends and acute stress subsides. however, some people fall into a vicious pattern of sleep loss and daytime anxiety about sleep that eventually snowballs into chronic insomnia. in addition to insomnia, chronic stress can lead to sleep apnea.
when talking about memory foam, what is important to address?	what is memory foam	in addition, there are people who love some qualities of memory foam, but could do without others. when talking about memory foam, it is therefore important to address both commonly reported benefits and commonly reported complaints. provides pressure relief: memory foam contours to the body, using your own body heat and pressure to conform to your shape. this can provide relief in areas of the body we put the most pressure on during sleep, such as the hips, shoulders, and neck. putting regular, disproportionate pressure on those parts of the body can cause pain upon waking, as well as trouble getting to sleep and staying asleep.
what quantity is melatonin available to purchase in?	can you overdose on melatonin	although melatonin supplements are considered natural, this does not necessarily mean they are harmless. categorized as a dietary supplement by the food and drug administration, melatonin regulation is loose in the u.s. and does not require the extensive research that prescription and over-the-counter sleep aids must undergo to earn access to consumers. while those struggling to sleep may be desperate to do as much as possible to get shut-eye, more is not always better. it is important to be aware of the safety risks posed by taking too much melatonin. melatonin is available to purchase in any quantity, without a prescription in the u.s.
what are a common cause of insufficient or low-quality sleep?	what causes restless sleep	pain, a frequent need to urinate, lung diseases, and heart problems are all examples of conditions that can interrupt sleep. pain, especially, and the inability to get comfortable in bed, may often be associated with restless sleep. a bedroom or sleep setting that's not conducive to good sleep can also contribute to restless sleep. finding the best mattress for your body type and sleep preferences plays a big role in achieving healthy sleep. an uncomfortable mattress, lots of noise or light, or excess heat or cold may interfere with dozing off or staying asleep. poor sleep habits, which are part of sleep hygiene, are a common cause of insufficient or low-quality sleep.
what does the contouring effect help minimize?	mattress firmness	mattresses that are responsive and bouncy make movement easier, while those that absorb motion can make it more challenging. additionally, a surface that sinks deeply may inhibit movement. that said, contouring can also enhance traction. while responsiveness and contouring are determined largely by materials, couples often find that softer models provide extra traction but are more difficult to move on. some other factors to consider include edge support and noise potential. mattresses with stronger perimeters let couples use the entire surface, and quiet models allow greater discretion. firmer mattresses frequently have sturdier edges, though soft models may include reinforced perimeters to make the full surface usable.
what is sleep paralysis?	what are the symptoms of narcolepsy	people may fall asleep at any moment, with brief naps ranging from just a few seconds to several minutes. they often wake from these short naps feeling much more alert and awake. during lapses in attention or brief periods of sleep, people with narcolepsy may perform activities with no conscious awareness and little memory of them afterward. while performing habitual activities, like eating, talking or typing, they may fall asleep and automatically continue the activity. usually, their performance declines, with a common example being writing that becomes an illegible scribble during brief sleep attacks. sleep paralysis is a temporary loss of voluntary muscle control while waking up or falling asleep.
what should sleepers who are unsure about their health risks do?	how heavy should a weighted blanket be	this is especially true for people with conditions that affect breathing because a blanket that is too heavy can restrict airflow and make breathing more difficult. even for people who do not suffer from severe medical conditions, a weighted blanket may be too constricting and make them feel claustrophobic. as a general rule, sleepers who are unsure about their health risks should consult a physician before buying a weighted blanket.

why is it important for children to only use their bed for sleeping?	how to choose a mattress	good sleep is vital for children. kids need more hours of sleep than adults, and sleeping well is important during all stages of childhood development. outfitting their bed with a quality mattress is a central part of making sure that children get the sleep that they need. knowing how to choose a mattress for a child has quite a bit of overlap with choosing a mattress for an adult, but there are meaningful differences to take into account. one key difference is that safety is a greater concern when shopping for beds for children, especially infants who sleep in cribs.
when were children more likely to report difficulties going to sleep as well as a greater likelihood of having social jet lag?	custody arrangements affect youth sleep habits	children with separated parents may be more likely to have more difficulty falling asleep, social jet lag, and later bedtimes, according to a new study. the sweden-based study surveyed more than 11,000 student participants ages 11 to 15 about their sleep habits and home dynamics. researchers found that when custody was shared but not equal, children were more likely to report difficulties going to sleep as well as a greater likelihood of having social jet lag. this occurs when varying sleep routines on weekdays and weekends makes it more difficult to adjust to daily activities. the study also found that children who lived in one household with one parent were more likely to have later bedtimes and social jet lag.
why can sleep aids carry extra risks for people with alzheimer's?	alzheimers: managing sleep disturbances	the routine use of medications to treat sleep issues in patients with alzheimer's disease is not supported by current scientific evidence. sleep aids carry extra risks for people with alzheimer's; they can cause falls and injury, increase memory loss and confusion, and may have an overly sedative effect. sleep aids are typically reserved for cases where all other options have been exhausted and should only be given under guidance of a physician. melatonin supplements have been studied as a possible option for improving sleep quality in alzheimer's patients. however, research examining the effectiveness of melatonin supplements in people with dementia has produced conflicting results.
what is melatonin?	how to sleep when its too hot outside	when the sun goes down, your eyes will perceive darkness and signal the scn accordingly. this triggers the release of melatonin, the hormone that induces feelings of tiredness and relaxation. this also causes your core temperature to dip. once you go to bed, your body temperature will continue to decrease during the first two stages of your sleep cycle, which consist of non-rapid eye movement (nrem) sleep. your temperature will eventually reach its lowest point and maintain this lower level for the remainder of the night. most people will experience a drop of roughly 2 degrees fahrenheit while they sleep.
what does the type of transfer aid a caretaker use depends on?	sleep and bedroom safety for seniors	these devices can help prevent falls in the bedroom. transitioning people from one location to another can be challenging for caregivers. some transfer aids are designed to help caretakers safely move people in household settings. these devices should not be used without an aide's assistance. the type of transfer aid a caretaker uses depends on factors related to the person they are helping, such as their mobility range, height and weight, and household layout. a transfer chair might not be useful in a small apartment, for example, while larger people may need a patient lift.
what should be done with mold growing in your bedroom?	mold in the bedroom: how it impacts sleep	if you're inspecting your bedroom for mold, it's important to know that mold can grow for some time before it becomes visible. you may also see mold develop in areas with regular moisture or condensation. for example, black mold spots may become visible in corners of your bedroom or behind furniture that is kept up against the wall. sometimes mold may be concealed underneath wallpaper, paneling, carpet, or behind walls. if you suspect that hidden mold is growing in your bedroom, it's smart to consider hiring a professional who can perform a thorough investigation of your home.
how does cbt-i work?	how to talk to your doctor about your sleep	cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia, or cbt-i, may also be recommended. cbt-i focuses on helping you recognize the thoughts and behaviors that disturb your sleep (such as nighttime stress or worry, or drinking too much caffeine) and replacing them with behaviors that enable healthy sleep. if your doctor suspects a sleep disorder is causing your sleep issues, they may refer you to a sleep specialist. sleep specialists have specialized training in sleep medicine, and they will ask you more questions about your symptoms before providing a specific diagnosis or treatment recommendation. often, they will perform an overnight sleep study (known as a polysomnogram) where they monitor your sleep along with other vitals like your brainwaves, breathing, and eye and limb movements.
what is thought to prompt higher dream recall?	how often do we dream	one of the most accepted theories is that in order to remember a dream, the sleeper must briefly wake up afterward. according to this theory, memory processing more or less shuts down while we dream. a subsequent period of wakefulness is necessary to store the dream in long-term memory. proponents of this theory have yet to agree on whether people who remember more dreams actually dream more, or whether they are just more likely to remember their dreams. individual traits may influence dream recall. taking an active interest in dreams and generally being open to new experiences are thought to prompt higher dream recall.
what must your choice of cpap mask follow?	how to use a cpap machine	other masks go over the nose or just underneath it. your doctor or sleep specialist will recommend a mask based on several factors including how you breathe, the pressure you need, and your sleeping position. regardless of the type of mask you use, it will be held in place using one or more straps that go around the top and/or back of your head. start by positioning the mask on your face, and then attach or pull the straps to secure it. the mask should form a seal against your face, but it should not pinch or press deeply into your skin.
when do many women report greater dream recall?	how often do we dream	people who often remember their dreams are also less likely to undergo the groggy period known as sleep inertia when they first wake up, which may facilitate dream memory storage. some researchers propose that we are more likely to remember dreams with intense emotional content. people may be more or less likely to remember their dreams depending on what sleep stage they were in when they woke up. lighter sleep and activity in certain brain regions seem to correlate with higher dream recall. keeping a dream diary may help you remember your dreams. additionally, improving your sleep hygiene and achieving the recommended amount of sleep for your age group may lead to longer rem periods and more dreams.
what is widely considered to be the most common cause of excessive sleepiness?	how is excessive sleepiness diagnosed	do you feel sleepy on a regular basis? if you have trouble staying awake during the day, you may have excessive sleepiness, and you're not alone. one in five people suffers from excessive sleepiness. in fact, excessive sleepiness is one of the most common sleep complaints people have besides insomnia. unfortunately, many people go about their daily lives feeling excessively sleepy without mentioning it to their doctor. sometimes, people brush off sleepiness laziness, or a lack of motivation, when it can actually be a symptom of something more serious. excessive sleepiness takes a toll on your work, school, relationships, and daily life.
what can restless sleep in infants be caused by?	what causes restless sleep	some babies start to have more restless sleep at around nine months. this can occur from separation anxiety at bedtime, greater recognition and control of their environment, overstimulation, and/or napping too soon before bedtime. to help newborns and infants sleep soundly, parents should cultivate healthy sleep habits. reinforcing good habits can resolve restless sleep in babies and pave the way for better sleep as they get older. parents should also carefully follow safety precautions to prevent sudden infant death syndrome (sids). though uncommon, restless sleep in infants can be caused by an underlying health problem.
what is one way to learn more about your sleep situation?	children and sleep tracking	this wearables experience changed me, maybe more than it changed my daughter. i found myself altering how i approached her right from the beginning of the day depending on how well she slept. if she didn't sleep well or i noticed a lot of nighttime disturbances in her graph, i would allow her more leeway. giving her the benefit of doubt seemed to ease the bumps we'd hit throughout our daytime hours together, and even allow us to have a quiet and calm drift into the evening. this insight into my daughter's nine-year-old brain made me realize something so simple: we're not that much different.
what will the terms and conditions of a mattress warranty vary depending on?	mattress warranties	if you're shopping for a mattress, you may notice that most mattresses come with a warranty. this warranty protects customers from a faulty product. it's important to seek out and understand the warranty terms of your mattress before committing to purchasing it. the length, terms, type, and coverage of a mattress warranty vary depending on the company and the product. shoppers will want to consider what is covered and what isn't, in order to ease any potential concerns prior to purchase. there are also steps every customer can take to care for their mattress to prevent voiding their warranty.
what are some main signs or symptoms of restless sleep that are often found the next day?	what causes restless sleep	despite this, there's a general sense of what it looks or feels like to have restless sleep. restless sleep is in the eye of the beholder; how it is perceived depends on whether you're the one trying to sleep or if you're observing someone else. in addition, a main sign or symptom of restless sleep is often found the next day, when you may feel tired, sluggish, or mentally off. if restless sleep happens regularly, these issues may become increasingly problematic and even dangerous if you're drowsy while driving or operating heavy machinery. with some of these signs of restlessness, such as talking or moving during sleep, the person is likely to be totally unaware of their behavior and won't remember it when they wake up.
how are menstruation and moon phase correlated?	how lunar phases can have an effect on your sleep	modern research investigating the relationship between moon phase, female reproductive patterns, and sleep is conflicting. one study spanning 15 years found that participants' menstrual cycles intermittently synchronized with the lunar phase, with menses occurring just before the full moon or new moon. an analysis of data from women using a period-tracking smartphone app looked for an association between sleep onset, menstruation, and lunar phase. menstruation and moon phase were not correlated. however, those with periods that started when the moon was more than half full reported better sleep. women whose cycles began when the moon was less than half full generally had worse sleep.
what is circadian rhythm controlled by?	coronasomnia: definition, symptoms, and solutions	after the covid-19 outbreak, these routines were suddenly flexible, or even gone. for some people, these changes contributed to a phase-delay insomnia. they started going to bed later and waking up later. they also reported lower sleep quality, despite spending more time in bed. these symptoms were more pronounced for people with higher rates of depression, anxiety, and stress. without a daily routine, it's tougher for your circadian rhythm to stay on track. when the circadian rhythm gets disrupted, it's not just sleep that's affected. your circadian rhythm regulates a host of biological functions, including your digestion, appetite, immune response, and more.
where can pseudoephedrine be found?	what not to do before bed	certain medications can interfere with sleep by elevating the heart rate or raising blood pressure, which can negatively affect sleep. as a result, it is important to know when to take medications to help avoid sleep disturbances as much as possible. also, some people report that common medications such as decongestants, or pseudoephedrine, cause problems with sleeping. some people may experience restless legs syndrome, a disorder that often interferes with a person's ability to fall asleep, as a result of taking pseudoephedrine. pseudoephedrine is found in cold or allergy medications, including sudafed. you might be wondering, does sudafed keep you awake? if you take these types of medications, you may want to try a nighttime version, such as sudafed nighttime.
how long do latex mattresses tend to last?	when should you replace your mattress	latex mattresses are the most durable, lasting upwards of 8 years. depending on the material, there are a few good ways to predict durability. for innerspring and hybrid mattresses, look for a lower coil gauge (which means thicker coils). for mattresses with foam, look for higher foam densities (1.7+ pcf for polyfoam, 5+ pcf for memory foam). finally, make sure you're getting natural latex rather than synthetic latex. maintenance & care - like any other product, a mattress will last longer if you take good care of it. this means rotating your mattress every 3 months or so (unless the manufacturer recommends otherwise) and utilizing a mattress protector.
what will help a toddler become comfortable with the new bed before it becomes their primary sleep space?	when should you switch to a toddler bed	if they get out of bed during the night, give them positive reinforcement when they go back to their bedroom. once your toddler transitions to a bed, you can not rely on a crib to keep them in place anymore. with a bed, your toddler can climb out and explore around the house. once your toddler has more freedom, they may take advantage of it. it helps to be patient and stay consistent with bedtime rules. before bed, remind your child that now is the time to use the bathroom one last time or squeeze in one more hug.
what do sleepers describe their fever dreams as?	fever dreams: causes and meaning	in fact, one study of 299 dreams showed that half of the dreams contained at least one component tied to a specific daytime experience. as a result, fever dreams may include feelings of heat and illness. the exact cause of fever dreams is unknown. some researchers speculate that the overheated brain affects cognitive processing and therefore makes the fever dreams more strange than typical dreams. fevers can also interrupt rem sleep, which may lead to other sleep changes, including unusual dreams. fever dreams differ from other dreams in that they are often more vivid and unusual.
what impacts the price-point of a platform bed?	platform bed ideas	platform beds are usually low-profile and have a more modern look. this simple design is often less expensive than buying a bed frame and a separate box spring. platform beds are suitable for all types of mattresses. however, they tend to be paired with foam mattresses, which generally don't require a box spring. platform beds are available at a broad range of prices for virtually all budgets. more affordable models are between $100 and $400, while high-end models can be $500 or more. several factors influence the price of a platform bed. the quality of the materials, manufacturing location, brand, and size all impact the price-point.
what is one major benefit of memory foam mattresses for people with allergies?	what is memory foam	for people with allergies, one major benefit of memory foam mattresses is that they tend to be hypoallergenic. because of their dense structure, memory foam mattresses are less likely to attract and accumulate allergens, such as dust mites, mold, and other common irritants. reduces motion transfer: for co-sleepers and couples-especially those who are light sleepers-making sure you can't feel it if your partner moves or gets up at night is very important when considering a mattress. if preventing motion transfer is a priority for you, memory foam has a significant advantage. because of the density of memory foam and the way it responds to and distributes pressure, it does a good job of keeping motion on one part of the bed from being felt on another part of the bed.
how many types of sleep apnea are there?	sleep apnea treatment	sleep apnea is a form of sleep-disordered breathing, which is an umbrella term for conditions that cause people to breathe abnormally or experience lapses in breathing as they sleep. there are two main types of sleep apnea. obstructive sleep apnea (osa) involves pauses or reduced breathing during sleep due to complete or partial airway blockages. by contrast, for people with central sleep apnea (csa), breathing stops during sleep as a result of issues with the brain or nervous system. doctors give a mixed sleep apnea diagnosis when a person shows signs of both disorders. different research studies return different estimates for how many people have sleep apnea.
what type of latex is the least likely to cause noise and movement disturbances for people sharing a bed?	how is latex density measured	for example, some constructions have interchangeable layers that allow sleepers to adjust the firmness and feel of the bed. latex density greatly influences a mattress' performance and lifespan. while latex is generally resilient, durability typically increases with density. density also plays a key role in performance areas that are often important to couples, including bounce and motion isolation. low-density latex is the most responsive, making it more conducive for sex. motion isolation, on the other hand, increases with density. high-density latex is therefore the least likely to cause noise and movement disturbances for people sharing a bed.
what has a sedative effect due to a chemical compound called cedrol?	essential oils to help you get more sleep	the sedative effects of cedrol have been studied in both animals and humans. inhaling an essential oil mixture that contains cedrol has been demonstrated to improve sleep quality in both young, healthy adults and older adults with dementia, likely because it activates the parasympathetic nervous system. researchers recommend using cedarwood oil for at least 20 nights to see effects. cedarwood oil, along with other essential oils, may increase total sleep time and reduce early morning awakenings. cedarwood oil appears to be versatile, improving sleep in a variety of different types of people. one study focused on women in their 20s, 30s, and 40s living in japan, norway, and thailand.
when should you talk to a doctor about your sleep apnea?	how to stop snoring	you should also contact a doctor if home care treatments do not relieve your symptoms. it is extremely important to speak with a doctor if you have any symptoms of sleep apnea in addition to snoring. even if you are not experiencing sleep apnea symptoms, you can still benefit from discussing any sleep concerns with a medical professional. a doctor will perform a physical examination, paying special attention to your nose and mouth. they will also note any other health conditions you may have or medications you take. they may ask your bed partner for their observations. if your doctor suspects that you have sleep apnea, they may refer you to a sleep specialist for a sleep study, in which they measure your breathing and other signs while you sleep. based on the results, your health team can develop an individualized care plan to help you stop snoring and treat any related conditions.
what does our brain process during rem sleep?	rem sleep: what it is and why it matters	your brain processes emotions during rem sleep. dreams, which are more vivid in rem sleep, may be involved in emotional processing. also, your amygdala, the part of your brain that processes emotions, activates during rem sleep. during rem sleep, your brain processes new learnings and motor skills from the day, committing some to memory, maintaining others, and deciding which ones to delete. some memory consolidation also takes place in deep sleep, a non-rem stage. researchers hypothesize rem sleep promotes brain development, since newborns spend most of their sleep time in rem. adding to the evidence is that animals born with less developed brains, such as humans and puppies, spend even more time in rem sleep during infancy than those that are born with more developed brains, like horses and birds.
how can experiencing cataplexy feel?	cataplexy: causes, symptoms, and treatment	suvorexant, a medication for insomnia that blocks orexin, can cause cataplexy in rare cases. fortunately, cataplexy typically disappears after patients stop taking these medications. diagnosing cataplexy can be a challenge. there isn't a specific test to detect cataplexy, although it has been suggested that video recordings of episodes may be a helpful tool. cataplexy is usually diagnosed based on an interview with patients and their families. in an interview, doctors are looking for the classic signs of cataplexy. a doctor may ask about how often a person experiences episodes and how long they last, triggering events, and which muscles are affected.
why do workplace naps provide a great benefit to employees and their work?	companies that embrace the power nap	each of the room's four massage chairs has a curved hood so employees can lie back and watch fish swimming above them. former zappos ceo tony hsieh shared his thinking behind the tank and other amenities with marketplace in 2010 : for us, our number one priority as a company is company culture, and our whole belief is that if we get the culture right then most of the other stuff like delivering great customer service or building a long-term enduring brand will just happen naturally on its own. zappos employees can nap in the tank during lunchtime, work breaks, or whenever they feel like they need a quick snooze to recharge. workplace naps provide a great benefit to employees and their work. naps enhance alertness, strengthen memory, and improve emotions. researchers suggest that employers look at the cost of not allowing naps. if working for an employer who helps you stay healthy, rested, and happy to work is important to you, consider looking for opportunities at nap-friendly workspaces.
what should you do to combat the potential dehydration that often accompanies higher doses of caffeine?	why coffee can make you tired	different people have different sensitivity levels to caffeine, so if you notice that caffeine is negatively impacting you, it may help to reduce the amount you consume. be mindful of what you eat with your morning coffee and any sugar or sweetener you add to it. in many parts of the world, drinks like coffee have become hidden sources of added sugar in a person's diet. for people with diabetes, consuming sugar can prompt fatigue. additionally, caffeine consumption can negatively impact the body's ability to properly manage sugar, potentially increasing any resulting fatigue. to combat the potential dehydration that often accompanies higher doses of caffeine, be sure to drink plenty of water. this is especially relevant if you do not regularly consume coffee, as you may be more sensitive to its diuretic effects.
when do hypnopompic hallucinations occur?	what are hypnopompic hallucinations	hypnopompic hallucinations are hallucinations that occur in the morning as you're waking up. they are very similar to hypnagogic hallucinations, or hallucinations that occur at night as you're falling asleep. when you experience these hallucinations, you see, hear, or feel things that aren't actually there. sometimes these hallucinations occur alone, and other times they occur in conjunction with sleep paralysis. for most people, hypnopompic hallucinations are considered normal and are not cause for concern. they generally don't indicate an underlying mental or physical illness, though they may be more common in people with certain sleep disorders.
what can parent involvement in bedtime routines and establishing consistent bedtimes for both the parent and child support?	when should you switch to a toddler bed	this can normalize the bed as a place for quiet and rest. at night, keep everything else consistent about your toddler's bedtime routine as you begin to transition them to a bed. whether you listen to lullabies, have a bath, or read stories together, continue following the same activities in the same order every night. bedtime routines reinforce to your child that it is time for bed, even if they are sleeping somewhere a little bit different. bedtime routines can also help strengthen your bond with your child and have been found to improve sleep in children and improve the moods of their mothers.
who may off-gassing not be a concern for?	off-gassing	however, you may be able to smell traces for several days to a few weeks, particularly if the model contains primarily synthetic foam. for most sleepers, the compounds emitted during off-gassing are generally harmless. vocs associated with synthetic foam do not pose major known health risks, but they may be irritating for sleepers with respiratory conditions or chemical sensitivities. for those who are sensitive to strong odors, off-gassing may cause temporary symptoms, such as headache, nausea, or dizziness. however, for most individuals, the biggest concern is the unpleasant smell.
what is an indentation load deflection (ild) rating?	what is memory foam	think of it as a more nuanced goldilocks and the three bears scenario: some people like their mattresses very firm, some like them very soft, and some like them somewhere in the middle. most mattresses will be described in-store or online as landing somewhere on the soft-firm scale. however, if that info isn't there or if it isn't detailed enough, you can look for an indentation load deflection (ild) rating. this is basically a measure of firmness: the higher the ild rating, the firmer you can expect the mattress to be. according to the way ilds are scored, each layer of the mattress (ie, comfort, transition, support, etc.) has its own ild score, and then the mattress as a whole has an overall ild score.
what is not typically covered by a mattress warranty?	nectar vs. layla mattress comparison	most companies include a warranty of at least 10 years with the mattress purchase in order to protect consumers against premature defects. in some cases, customers are responsible for an increasing portion of the repair or replacement costs as time goes on. this is referred to as prorated warranty coverage. mattress warranties may cover manufacturing and workmanship defects in the cover, splitting or cracking of the foam, permanent indentations, or other such defects. in general, mattresses that are soiled, smelly, or otherwise abused, as well as mattresses that have been used without a proper foundation, are not eligible for warranty coverage.
what have snoring and obstructive sleep apnea during pregnancy both been linked to?	how to sleep when pregnant: common issues and tips	sleep deprivation also causes a stress response in the body that may cause an increased risk of postpartum depression and premature birth. snoring and obstructive sleep apnea during pregnancy have both been linked to an increased risk of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and unplanned c-section. obstructive sleep apnea may also increase the risk of preterm birth and low birth weight. sleep problems can take many different forms during pregnancy. hormonal fluctuations often cause people to sleep more during the first trimester. the circadian clock guiding a person's sleep cycle may also fall back, leading them to fall asleep earlier in the evening.
how often should mattresses be replaced?	how to fix a sagging mattress	typically, this includes areas that support the hips and shoulders. a sagging mattress will provide uneven support, which can significantly reduce comfort and sleep quality. if your mattress is sagging, it may need to be replaced. the strategies described in this article are meant to provide temporary improvements for a sagging mattress, but they won't fix the root problem. generally, mattresses should be replaced every 6 to 10 years. if your mattress begins to sag excessively, it should be replaced as soon as possible.
what may the differences between the genders be a product of?	how is sleep different for men and women	some researchers believe that many women have increased sleep quantity as an attempt to compensate for reduced sleep quality. it's important to remember that sleep can vary considerably from person to person and is influenced by a wide range of factors. studies showing differences in sleep quantity or quality reflect an aggregate; they don't mean that all women sleep more or have lower-quality sleep than men. there are both sex- and gender-based factors that influence how and why men and women sleep differently. sex-based factors relate to underlying biology including hormone production, sleep cycles, and circadian rhythm.
when should you consider help from a sleep specialist or other licensed professional?	how post-traumatic stress disorder affects sleep	this will help strengthen the mental association between your bed and sleep. if you're having trouble sleeping, or if you find yourself turning to substances such as drugs or alcohol to help you sleep, seek help from your doctor. they can help you find a therapist that provides cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (cbt-i), as well as ptsd-specific techniques such as imagery rehearsal therapy or exposure, relaxation, and rescripting therapy. they may also prescribe sleep medication, though this carries more risks and should be used with caution. learning to sleep soundly again after experiencing trauma may take some time, so don't feel defeated if it doesn't happen right away.
how much sleep should most adults between the ages of 18 and 64 get?	how to sleep better during the day	most adults between the ages of 18 and 64 should receive seven to nine hours of sleep every 24 hours. there is some wiggle room with these numbers, but we don't recommend sleeping fewer than six hours or more than 10 hours per day. let's say you work from 9 pm to 5 am five days per week. assuming a moderate commute each way, this leaves you with 14-15 hours allotted to personal time and a few options for planning your sleep schedule. some night shift workers prefer to get home and stay up for a few hours before going to bed, as one might do on a traditional 9-5 work schedule.
what are examples of habits and routines that can lead to restless sleep?	what causes restless sleep	having an inconsistent sleep schedule, using electronic devices in bed, and eating too late at night are examples of habits and routines that can lead to restless sleep. restless or disturbed sleep can also occur because of a misaligned circadian rhythm, which often occurs when working a night shift or suffering from jet lag after flying across multiple time zones. in some situations, restless sleep is tied to an underlying sleep disorder like insomnia, restless leg syndrome (rls), or sleep-related breathing disorders like obstructive sleep apnea (osa). in rls, a person feels a strong urge to move their limbs, and in osa, breathing is repeatedly interrupted, causing brief awakenings that circumvent the ability to sleep deeply.
what may off-gassing cause for those who are sensitive to strong odors?	off-gassing	however, you may be able to smell traces for several days to a few weeks, particularly if the model contains primarily synthetic foam. for most sleepers, the compounds emitted during off-gassing are generally harmless. vocs associated with synthetic foam do not pose major known health risks, but they may be irritating for sleepers with respiratory conditions or chemical sensitivities. for those who are sensitive to strong odors, off-gassing may cause temporary symptoms, such as headache, nausea, or dizziness. however, for most individuals, the biggest concern is the unpleasant smell.
what occurs during non-rapid eye movement (nrem) sleep?	what happens during nrem sleep	nrem has been primarily studied for its contributions to physical recovery and memory consolidation. researchers have proposed that abnormalities in nrem sleep processes may play a role in schizophrenia, epilepsy, alzheimer's and parkinson's disease, and autism spectrum disorders. traditionally, nrem sleep has been viewed as a time of rest. in support of this theory, researchers have found that the brain uses significantly less energy during nrem sleep. by contrast, during nrem sleep, people with insomnia display brain waves that are similar to wakefulness. they also maintain a faster metabolism and heart rate, indicating they are unable to fully relax.
why is it important to find and treat the cause of your hypercapnia?	what is hypercapnia	if they suspect your hypercapnia could be due to sleep apnea, they may perform an overnight sleep test, called polysomnography. they will also ask you questions about your medical history. treatment for hypercapnia is generally directed at treating the underlying problem. if your hypercapnia is due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, your doctor may ask you to limit your exposure to smoke and prescribe medications. if you have obstructive sleep apnea, lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking, losing weight if you are overweight, and avoiding alcohol and sedatives before bedtime may ease symptoms. for hypercapnia that is exacerbated by medication, ask your doctor about lowering doses or switching medications.
why may memory foam mattresses often cost more than basic polyfoam models?	what is memory foam	most memory foams fall between 3.5 and 5 pcf, though some foams fall outside that range. high-density foam generally has a longer lifespan than low-density foam. because high-density options have more foam present per cubic foot, it takes longer for the material to break down. however, high-density foam traps heat easily, so shoppers have to weigh the pros and cons of foam densities before purchasing. many mattress companies effectively layer different density foams to achieve the best performance possible. memory foam mattresses often cost more than basic polyfoam models because of the high-quality materials used to manufacture them.
what does the circadian rhythm do?	coronasomnia: definition, symptoms, and solutions	after the covid-19 outbreak, these routines were suddenly flexible, or even gone. for some people, these changes contributed to a phase-delay insomnia. they started going to bed later and waking up later. they also reported lower sleep quality, despite spending more time in bed. these symptoms were more pronounced for people with higher rates of depression, anxiety, and stress. without a daily routine, it's tougher for your circadian rhythm to stay on track. when the circadian rhythm gets disrupted, it's not just sleep that's affected. your circadian rhythm regulates a host of biological functions, including your digestion, appetite, immune response, and more.
where can guided sleep meditation videos be found?	how sleep meditation works	if you would prefer guided sleep meditations, you may want to consider sleep meditation apps, videos, or playlists. meditation and mindfulness apps are popular, and there is a wide variety available. once you have more of an idea of what type of app you are looking for, your options might not feel so overwhelming. guided sleep meditation videos can be found online through youtube. additionally, you can find both guided and unguided meditation playlists on spotify, apple music, and pandora radio. it may take some experimentation to find what types of videos and playlists work best for you.
why should you try not to overindulge at dinnertime?	does turkey make you tired	if the turkey is not to blame, then what makes you tired during the holidays? other customs, foods and beverages, and seasonal responses may contribute to your sleepiness. a holiday food table is often packed with tasty dishes. while additional helpings of pumpkin pie may taste delicious, eating too much food can make you sleepy. research shows that high-carbohydrate, high-fat meals lead to post-meal sleepiness, with peak fatigue happening an hour to an hour and a half after you finish eating. carbohydrate-based, high-glycemic-index meals also cause you to fall asleep faster. the glycemic index measures how quickly food increases your blood sugar.
what does suvorexant block?	cataplexy: causes, symptoms, and treatment	suvorexant, a medication for insomnia that blocks orexin, can cause cataplexy in rare cases. fortunately, cataplexy typically disappears after patients stop taking these medications. diagnosing cataplexy can be a challenge. there isn't a specific test to detect cataplexy, although it has been suggested that video recordings of episodes may be a helpful tool. cataplexy is usually diagnosed based on an interview with patients and their families. in an interview, doctors are looking for the classic signs of cataplexy. a doctor may ask about how often a person experiences episodes and how long they last, triggering events, and which muscles are affected.
what is caffeine?	tips for creating a bedtime routine	however, establishing regular times to fall asleep each night and wake up each morning is an important first step toward creating an effective bedtime routine. caffeine is a stimulant that creates temporary feelings of alertness, which can interfere with your sleep cycle. the effects of caffeine usually peak about 30 minutes after consumption. for most people, drinking coffee or caffeinated soft drinks in the morning or early afternoon has a minimal effect on nighttime sleep. however, caffeine can continue to have noticeable effects for up to seven hours after you have consumed it, so it is best avoided in the afternoon and evening.
how can the way a person is affected by insomnia vary?	how sleep latency impacts the quality of your sleep	a person's age and the number of naps they take may also affect sleep latency. when sleep professionals talk about sleep efficiency, they are generally referring to the percentage of time a person spends asleep at night. to calculate this, they take a ratio of the total amount of time a person was asleep on a given night divided by the total amount of time they spent in bed, then multiply that by 100 to create a percentage. when treating insomnia, doctors usually aim for a sleep efficiency of at least 85%. sleep efficiency is a different measure than sleep latency, but the two are closely linked.
what symptoms may occur from mold exposure in people with underlying health conditions or a weakened immune system?	mold in the bedroom: how it impacts sleep	more severe symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath, and lung infection may occur from mold exposure in people with underlying health conditions or a weakened immune system. children exposed to mold in the first year of life may have an increased risk of developing asthma. in addition to the many health problems mold can cause, research suggests that mold exposure may also compromise sleep. in one large study, household molds were correlated with increased sleep problems like insomnia, snoring, and excessive daytime sleepiness. another study of nearly 5,000 adults found that people who reported mold odors at home also reported higher rates of sleep disturbances.
what has meditation been shown to reduce?	meditation before bed: how it works and tips	researchers are not completely certain why meditation improves sleep, but there could be many reasons. meditation can reduce stress, and it might be particularly helpful when a person has trouble falling asleep because of worry. meditation and mindfulness training help people notice their thoughts without becoming caught up in them, which can allow them to detach from their thoughts enough to fall asleep. meditation has been studied for its effects on improving pain associated with fibromyalgia, back pain, migraine, rheumatoid arthritis, irritable bowel syndrome, osteoarthritis, and other disorders. since pain often disrupts sleep, relieving pain may improve sleep.
how many hours of sleep are adults are supposed to get?	how sleep works: the science of sleep	according to the cdc, adults need at least seven hours of sleep every night for optimal health. this means spending nearly a third of your life sleeping. with so much time spent snoozing, it's natural to wonder why the process of sleep is so critical and how it works. we'll break down the basics, including the importance of sleep, what happens in your brain when you drift off, how your body knows when it's time for bed, and ways you can improve your chances of getting a great night's rest. scientists and medical experts are still hard at work unraveling the mysteries of sleep.
what can increase a person's risk of insomnia?	exercising for optimal sleep	if evening is the only time you have available for exercise, you might benefit more from exercising at night than not exercising at all. multiple studies suggest that people with insomnia benefit from aerobic workouts that build cardiorespiratory strength and that not engaging in regular physical activity increases a person's risk of insomnia. that said, if you notice nighttime exercise makes it more difficult for you to fall asleep, you might want to avoid it. there is no scientific consensus regarding the best or worst time of day to exercise for sleep, and research provides few conclusive answers.
why is latex a popular mattress material?	dunlop vs. talalay latex	latex is a natural material that is manufactured from the sap of rubber trees. it's used in a variety of manufacturing applications, including modern mattresses. latex mattresses are prized for their durability, superior cooling, and excellent pressure relief. while not as popular as memory foam beds, latex mattresses are becoming more common. manufacturers use two types of latex to make these beds: dunlop latex and talalay latex. but what is the difference between dunlop and talalay latex? which is a better choice for you? the difference between talalay and dunlop latex is in the way the materials are produced.
what are a known cause of allergic rhinitis?	nosebleeds at night: causes and how to get relief	it appears that air pollution may irritate the nasal lining, though more research is needed to fully understand this connection. seasonal allergies cause inflammation inside of the nose that may provoke nose bleeding. people with allergic rhinitis may also blow their noses more frequently than others. blowing your nose too hard, whether due to allergies, a cold, or a flu, is another nosebleed trigger. some people experience nosebleeds as a side effect of medication or medical treatments. it is important to discuss any concerns regarding your medication with your doctor. most nosebleeds that occur as a medication side effect are not considered serious.
what does regular exercise reduce the risk of?	exercising for optimal sleep	one recent survey found that individuals who exercise in the evening take approximately the same amount of time to fall asleep as those who do not exercise at all. other studies suggest that rather than causing wakefulness, evening exercise appears to have a neutral or positive effect on most people's sleep quality. evidence suggests that regular exercise can help people with insomnia fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer. most studies of exercise and insomnia do not compare the effects of exercise performed at different times of day, however. generally, engaging in exercise may be able to help break the cycle of insomnia and physical inactivity since one often worsens the other.
what can letting your toddler make the final choice give them?	when should you switch to a toddler bed	too many changes at once might overwhelm your toddler and make the process harder on you both. many signs indicate your toddler is ready to switch from their crib to a toddler bed. you do not have to wait for all signs before starting the transition. when it is time for your child to switch to a bed, you can opt for a toddler bed or a twin bed with safety rails. toddler beds are smaller versions of a twin bed, which means your child will eventually grow out of a toddler bed. however, they are made with toddlers in mind, and often have built-in side rails to prevent falls.
what should you do if you get into bed and cannot fall asleep after 20 minutes?	your sleep questions answered	you can also try progressive muscle relaxation, a technique that involves sequentially tensing and then relaxing each muscle, from your toes to your head. music, meditation, and visualization may also help. if you lie in bed trying to fall asleep and more than 20 minutes pass, get up and go into another room. you want your brain to associate your bed with rest, not tossing and turning. it may help to do something that is quiet and relaxing. you might listen to some soothing music, draw or color, or read a nonfiction book. avoid using your cellphone, or turning on the tv or computer when you cannot fall asleep.
who are high-rise platform beds an excellent option for?	platform bed ideas	low-rise platform beds sit close to the ground. for sleepers who enjoy a modern look, the low-rise style is another excellent option. a low-profile bed can also help make your sleeping area feel more airy and spacious. high-rise platform beds are significantly taller than typical models. this is an excellent option for anyone who wants extra space for storage. high-rise platform beds are also ideal for sleepers who have trouble getting into and out of lower beds. building your own platform bed can allow you to customize the design. however, this option isn't right for everyone.
who has high rates of using electronic devices in their bedroom?	is it bad to watch tv right before bed	if you're dealing with stress, it can help you tune out the anxious chatter in your mind, a major contributor to insomnia. the comfort that watching tv before bed provides contributes to its popularity. in one survey, nearly one-third of adults reported using tv as a sleep aid. watching tv before bed may be a common way to lull yourself to sleep, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's a healthy habit. the majority of emerging research shows that too much screen time, especially right before bed, can negatively impact your sleep quality. generally, using electronic devices right before falling asleep is associated with poor sleep quality and time shifting, a process that results in later bedtimes and later rise times.
how long does the average mattress last?	how to fix a sagging mattress	we'll explain why mattresses sag and how you can make a sagging mattress more comfortable. we'll also share information on prolonging the life of your mattress and when you should replace it. mattresses sag for several reasons. we'll highlight some of the most common contributing factors. on average, mattresses last between six and eight years. if your mattress is approaching the end of its life expectancy, sagging may be the result of normal wear and tear. durability depends partially on the quality and type of materials. mattresses with higher quality components usually outlast lower quality alternatives.
how much sleep should adults between the ages of 19 and 64 sleep per night?	how to get more rem sleep	most research has focused on the mental effects of rem sleep. rem has physical impacts, too, and seems to protect against obesity. also, emerging evidence suggests that missing the rem sleep period near the end of the night may increase next-day appetite. adults need at least seven hours of sleep every night. rem sleep should make up around 20% to 25% of a person's total time asleep. that said, experts usually give recommendations for overall sleep time rather than for rem sleep in particular, as the body tends to self-regulate to maintain a balanced level of sleep stages.
what can take a toll on psychological well being and create sleep problems that can last for months afterwards?	sleep guidelines and help during the covid-19 pandemic	canceled vacations, reduced face time with family and friends, and an abundance of time spent at home can place a strain on anyone. keeping up with work-from-home obligations, managing a house full of children who are accustomed to being at school, or trying to stay current on pandemic news and restrictions can all generate stress and discord. chronic stress can lead to a host of mental and physical symptoms, including impaired sleep, headaches, memory lapses, and digestive problems. stress can also trigger fatigue that leaves you unmotivated and short of energy even if you are getting an adequate amount of sleep at night.
what should you do when approaching your employer?	natural sleep aids: which ones are safe	finding dependable natural sleep aids can be a challenge given the huge range of brands and products on the market. being a cautious shopper can reduce the risk of taking mislabeled or tainted supplements. start by looking carefully at the product's ingredient list. remember that product labels may use terms like natural, verified, or certified in ways that are not strictly defined or regulated. customers who want to research specific products can contact the manufacturer of a natural sleep aid and ask for documentation about testing and safety. information about quality assurance in the manufacturing process can also be illuminating in some cases.
what are examples of benefits a regular bedtime routine has?	sleeps impact on youth athletics and physical development	kids in this age group are still developing the physical skills they need to play organized sports. at this age, some children may begin to drop their daily nap. like teens and adults, however, young children who are especially active may benefit from additional sleep. bedtime routines can help preschool-aged kids fall asleep more easily. children who follow a regular bedtime routine are more likely to consistently sleep better. routines have also shown to improve kids' and parents' moods, lower household stress levels, and lead to better learning outcomes. to help your preschooler get more sleep, consider implementing a 30-40 minute bedtime routine that combines physical contact like cuddling, language-based activities like storytelling or singing, and hygiene activities like brushing teeth or bathing.
what changes may you observe in your pet if they are experiencing illness?	how long do cats sleep	as your cat ages, they also require more sleep. however, unusual sleep or excessive wakefulness patterns may indicate an underlying health condition. if they are experiencing illness, you may observe other changes in your pet, such as a change in bathroom habits, signs of disorientation, or unusual weight gain or loss. you know your cat's behavior best. if you observe an unusual change, especially alongside other symptoms, talk to your veterinarian. they can help determine the cause of your cat's changes and identify if they are normal or require further investigation.
what does off-gassing refer to?	off-gassing	off-gassing occurs when you remove a mattress from its packaging for the first time. it is especially noticeable with mattress-in-a-box mattresses because vacuum sealing them traps chemical byproducts until you open the package in your home. off-gassing odors pose no known serious health risks, but they can be unpleasant. our assessments judge new mattresses on both the strength and persistence of their scents. a higher numerical rating means the new mattress smell is less severe and dissipates relatively quickly. the term off-gassing typically refers to volatile organic compound (voc) emissions. vocs are a specific byproduct of the synthetic foam manufacturing process, so they're most common in mattresses that contain polyfoam or memory foam.
what types of pillows can help prevent or reduce neck pain?	neck pain while sleeping: causes and prevention	studies have examined the effect multiple pillow types have on pain, finding that latex pillows may provide the most effective support for side sleepers. spring pillows and memory foam pillows can also help prevent or reduce neck pain. if you still wake up with neck pain after making adjustments to your sleep setup, you may be able to relieve symptoms by practicing neck exercises for mobility and strength. alternative treatments like chiropractic care, acupuncture, yoga, or massage may also be helpful. if the pain continues, see your doctor so they can screen for underlying problems and recommend treatment options. you can also ask your doctor about over-the-counter pain medications.
what are great resources for low-cost or even free materials?	platform bed ideas	once you determine the design of your platform bed, it's time to gather your tools and materials. think carefully about your plans before you purchase materials to avoid going over budget. for example, a standard low-profile platform bed generally costs less to build than a storage platform bed with drawers. that's part of the fun of building your own platform bed. while diy projects can get expensive, it is possible to keep costs low when building your own platform bed. renting, borrowing, or purchasing tools secondhand is one easy way to cut costs. for raw materials, consider repurposing old items, such as shipping pallets or headboards. thrift stores and community marketplace websites are great resources for low-cost or even free materials. getting creative can help you save money and craft a truly unique piece.
what acts as a protective function against insomnia?	stress and insomnia	proper sleep hygiene can also improve your sleep quality and duration, leaving you more refreshed in the morning and prepared to manage stress. laying in bed when you are too stressed to sleep can be counterproductive. if you haven't gone to sleep within 15 minutes of going to bed, try getting up and relocating to another area of your residence for a relaxing activity such as reading, meditating, or listening to calming music; avoid watching tv or other activities that involve blue light devices. some people also experience anxiety when they wake up in the middle of the night and see the time on their bedside clock.
when could couch sleeping contribute to neck and shoulder pain?	is sleeping on the couch a bad idea	since couches are designed for sitting and not sleeping, they might not adequately support sleepers. stomach sleepers may find it virtually impossible to sleep on a couch, as the armrests cause the neck to twist at an excessively sharp angle. research also suggests that when back sleeping, symmetry is important to prevent neck pain. specifically, both arms should be in the same position, such as by your sides or on your chest. on a couch, back sleepers might lack the space required to easily keep both arms in the same position. if couch sleeping leads to an asymmetrical sleeping position, it could contribute to neck and shoulder pain.
how do binaural beats affect sleep?	binaural beats for sleep	to hear the binaural beat, you must have sound coming in each ear. if you take out one of your earbuds, you'll no longer hear the binaural beat. when binaural beats are sustained over a period of time, they can synchronize with your brain waves. as a result, binaural beats can alter your brain wave activity as well as your levels of arousal. binaural beats can be created at different frequencies. each frequency is associated with outcomes that correspond to different levels of brain wave activity. preliminary research suggests that binaural beats can help you sleep better.
what does the process of constructing a weighted blanket require?	how to make a weighted blanket	experts also recommend against using weighted blankets if you have sleep apnea, other respiratory illnesses, or circulatory conditions. always consult a doctor if you're not sure whether a weighted blanket is safe for you. constructing a weighted blanket is similar to sewing a regular blanket, but with extra fill to provide the weight. the process isn't too difficult but it does require a sewing machine, some tailoring skills, and time. the cost to purchase a weighted blanket can be quite steep, with some models costing up to $300. considering the high potential price-point, some people might find it more feasible to make one.
what does overcoming jet lag depend on?	how to get over jet lag: tips, suggestions, and treatments	many steps can also be taken to minimize symptoms caused by jet lag. overcoming jet lag depends on getting your body's 24-hour internal clock synchronized with the 24-hour day at your destination. because of these variables, there's no single remedy for jet lag. instead, quickly overcoming jet lag typically requires a plan that involves light exposure and melatonin. both are power influencers of the circadian rhythm and can help retrain your internal clock. proper timing is key to adjusting your circadian rhythm. in fact, light exposure and melatonin intake at the wrong time of the day can further desynchronize your circadian rhythm and exacerbate jet lag.
what is epilepsy?	epilepsy and sleep: challenges and solutions	epilepsy is a group of over 30 disorders in which abnormal brain activity causes a predisposition to seizures. it affects around 1 in 26 americans and is the 4th most common neurological disorder, after migraines, strokes, and alzheimer's disease. epilepsy and sleep have a bidirectional relationship, meaning that poor sleep may trigger epileptic seizures and, at the same time, having epilepsy can contribute to sleep issues. learning about this complex relationship can help people with epilepsy understand the impact that this condition has on sleep, know the risks of losing sleep, and empower them to take charge of their health.
what sleeping position can cause airway collapse due to gravity?	how to stop drooling in your sleep	when a sleeper lies on their back, gravity generally causes any excess saliva they produce to stay in their mouth or travel to their throat. in side and stomach sleepers, on the other hand, gravity is more likely to pull saliva down toward the pillow, resulting in drooling. if you are a side or stomach sleeper who sleeps with their mouth open, you may be even more likely to drool during sleep. sleeping on your back may help minimize drooling. you can also take measures to breathe out of your nose and keep your mouth closed as you sleep, such as using mouth tape.
what effect do most sleeping pills have?	treatments for non-24-hour sleep wake disorder	most sleeping pills act by directly inducing sleepiness, but they don't exert a significant effect on the circadian rhythm. a handful of small studies suggest that adding extra medications such as orexin receptor agonists to a standard treatment course may provide the extra push necessary to retrain the circadian rhythm for people with stubborn n24swd or comorbid disorders. vitamin b12 supplements, caffeine, and alcohol do not clearly exert a consistent or meaningful effect on the circadian rhythm. prescribed sleep-wake timing, strategic avoidance of light in the evening, or timed physical activity may influence the circadian rhythm, but these methods lack scientific evidence in people with n24swd.
when are melatonin levels in the placenta highest?	melatonin during pregnancy	naturally occurring melatonin appears to play a role in pregnancy, although more research is needed to fully understand how the hormone operates in this context. a pregnant woman's melatonin can cross the placenta and bind to receptors in a fetus, suggesting melatonin levels impact an unborn baby. additional melatonin may also be produced locally within the placenta. melatonin levels in a placenta are highest during the first trimester. a pregnant woman's melatonin levels increase after 24 weeks of pregnancy and again at 32 weeks. research suggests a woman's melatonin levels may influence her ability to become and stay pregnant.
what may different care guidelines apply depending on?	sleep aids: how to use them to treat insomnia	instead, doctors suggest insomnia treatments based on their patient's specific situation, including their symptoms and their overall health. to make these suggestions, doctors may draw on guidance from expert organizations like the american academy of sleep medicine (aasm). aasm organizes panels of sleep experts who review the existing research and make general recommendations about sleep aids. in the latest aasm guidelines for sleep aids for insomnia, certain prescription drugs are recommended depending on whether a person's problem is with sleep onset or sleep maintenance. this is because certain sleep aids work quickly and wear off fast, and others start slowly and last a long time.
how long are you likely to spend dreaming over the course of a night?	how often do we dream	among the countless intricacies of sleep we still seek to understand, many people are most fascinated by dreams. sleep science still has a long way to go before we grasp the full purpose of dreaming, but researchers are starting to understand more about how often we dream and how long dreams last. over the course of a night, you likely spend about two hours dreaming. however, it is difficult to gauge how long dreams last. since the dreamer is generally not conscious during the dream, researchers primarily rely on dream reports after the person wakes up.
what forces teens to wake up much earlier in the morning?	how to build a childs sleep habits	certainly all the research suggests, even with teenagers, that if you set them a bedtime they are more likely to get more sleep. so even when teenagers want to rule their own lives, giving them a bedtime is the way to go. sf: the stereotype of the teenager is one who stays up late and wakes up late; their circadian rhythm just shifts later, all-around. is that something we should be mindful of, or work to correct? or is that just what our bodies do when we're adolescents? dg: i think the western world does teenage students a disservice.
what are glasses informally as blue-blocking glasses or amber glasses designed to do?	technologys impact on sleep: screen time, blue light, and more	one study compared the sleep patterns of individuals who read a book before bedtime. one set of subjects read printed books, while the other group used e-readers that emitted blue light. the results indicated that the participants using light-emitting e-readers took longer to fall asleep, experienced poorer-quality sleep, and reported feeling less alert the following morning. specialized glasses with orange-tinted lenses designed to block blue light - known informally as blue-blocking glasses or amber glasses - have gained popularity in recent years. researchers have studied blue-blocking glasses for treating sleep disorders such as insomnia, delayed sleep-phase disorder, and shift work disorder, as well as jet lag.
how often should you clean your mattress?	how to take care of your mattress	blot any stains with a gentle cleanser, followed by a clean cloth dipped in cold water. be careful not to get the mattress too wet, especially if it's a memory foam or polyfoam mattress. allow the mattress to dry, and then apply baking soda to the surface of the mattress to soak up any lingering smells. give it a few hours to fully absorb, then vacuum up the baking soda using the upholstery attachment. repeat the process on the other side. in addition to routine maintenance, you may need to clean your mattress if you spill something or have another type of accident.
what does daily exercise contribute to?	coronasomnia: definition, symptoms, and solutions	daily exercise contributes to more restful sleep. exercise is also a great reliever of stress and anxiety. try to finish your workout at least 1 hour before bed. vigorous exercise energizes and heats up the body, so leave enough time for you to cool off and calm back down before bed. our minds are being overloaded with stressful information during the pandemic. it's easy to get caught up and overwhelmed by it all. help your mind stay calm and focused by setting a dedicated time to worry and take it all in. then, write down everything that's stressing you out.
what should you do if you have any concerns about your yoga practice?	how yoga can improve your sleep quality	such exercise, when done at least several hours before bedtime, can help you sleep better at night. since high-activity yoga forms elevate the heart rate, it's best to avoid these practices right before bedtime. poses done before bedtime should encourage the body to relax and sleep. keep in mind that the sleep environment should primarily be used for sleeping; find another quiet location to do your yoga poses before you go to sleep. be sure you are in a safe space free of any potential hazards. if you have any concerns about your yoga practice, consult a yoga instructor and/or a physician. remember that yoga is not a substitute for medical treatment. in the event of persistent sleep disturbances or other concerns, consult your physician to develop a treatment plan.
what can people who consume caffeine regularly develop?	why coffee can make you tired	as a result, turning to coffee to fix the effects of sleep deprivation can create a negative cycle. because you feel more tired, you drink more coffee, but that coffee disrupts your sleep, leading to more tiredness in the long run. rather than making you tired, it is possible that coffee simply is not making you as alert as it once did. initially, consuming caffeine can improve your mood and reaction times, as well as your physical performance. however, similar to the way people can develop a tolerance for alcohol, those who consume caffeine regularly develop a tolerance to it.
what can the mslt be used to diagnose?	multiple sleep latency test: overview	people undergo an mslt during daytime hours, usually the day after an overnight sleep study conducted in a sleep center or hospital. the mslt measures how long it takes a person to fall asleep and what sleep stages they experience across multiple short daytime nap opportunities. sleep specialists primarily use the mslt to diagnose narcolepsy and hypersomnia, two sleep disorders marked by excessive daytime sleepiness and sometimes oversleeping. excessive daytime sleepiness may also accompany insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, periodic limb movement disorder, and circadian rhythm disorders. additionally, excessive daytime sleepiness is a common symptom of neurological disorders, such as parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis.
what are the most important stages of sleep?	how noise can affect your sleep satisfaction	noise has a major impact on sleep. exposure to too much noise during sleep has immediate effects while we are sleeping, which leads to short-term issues the next day, and over time may result in long-term mental and physical consequences. noises at night might wake you up, and a fragmented night's sleep is less refreshing. even noises that don't wake you up have subconscious effects on sleep by changing the time we spend in certain sleep stages. sleep stages are the different types of sleep we cycle through each night, ranging from lighter stages (1 and 2) to deep (slow wave) sleep and rapid eye movement (rem).
what are men more likely to be resistant to?	the connection between sleep apnea and ptsd	unfortunately, the reverse is also true: untreated osa is associated with poorer outcomes for ptsd. adherence to cpap therapy is less common than doctors would like, simply because sleeping with the mask on can feel uncomfortable. individuals with ptsd are significantly less likely to use cpap therapy consistently, often due to masking discomfort, nightmares, and claustrophobia. nightmares in particular are associated with higher resistance to cpap therapy. individuals with ptsd use cpap therapy for a shorter amount of time - only 3.5 hours on average - and on fewer nights overall. a study of veterans found that among those without ptsd, 70% adhered to cpap therapy.
what is a concussion?	how to safely sleep with a concussion	a concussion is a type of mild traumatic brain injury. after a concussion, you might experience symptoms such as dizziness, confusion, headaches, and sleep difficulties. you might have heard that it is not safe to sleep with a concussion, or that you should be woken every few hours while you are recovering. we explore how concussions affect sleep, and how to sleep better so you can recover faster. generally, both adults and children can safely sleep after a concussion, once they have visited their doctor or an emergency room. although sleeping after a concussion is considered safe, it is more difficult to assess a person's symptoms when they are asleep.
what can contribute to facial wrinkles?	what are the best positions for sleeping	with a thicker pillow, your neck will stay aligned with your spine as you sleep on your side, preventing pain and soreness while maintaining proper alignment. side sleeping can lead to soreness or tightness in your shoulders, so it's good to shift positions occasionally and use the most appropriate pillow and mattress. ensure your mattress has enough give to allow your hips and shoulders to sink in deeper than your middle spine. side sleeping can also contribute to facial wrinkles, since your face is pressed against the pillow, stretching and compressing the skin. if you're already a side sleeper and want to go for that gold star, opt to sleep on your left instead of your right side.
who are the benefits of meditation enhanced in?	can meditation treat insomnia	at a biological level, meditation slows the heart rate and breathing and lowers levels of cortisol, the stress hormone. over the long term, the relaxation response reduces stress-related inflammation and oxidative stress and improves insulin resistance. the exact interplay between meditation and sleep is still being investigated, but it appears that meditation provokes lasting changes in the brain that may affect sleep. studies on people experienced in meditation have found that they display improvements in slow-wave sleep and rem sleep, as well as fewer nighttime awakenings. meditation is a skill, and those who practice it more often tend to see more meaningful benefits.
what is a normal part of having a new baby?	sleep deprivation and postpartum depression	sleep deprivation is an unavoidable part of being a new mother. the sudden shifts in hormone levels, accumulated fatigue from pregnancy, and round-the-clock demands of caring for a new baby can take their toll, and it's common for mothers to experience a dip in energy and mood during the first few weeks after giving birth. a majority of new mothers experience the so-called baby blues. for approximately one in eight women, these negative feelings become a persistent condition known as postpartum depression. distinguishing between sleep deprivation and postpartum depression can be difficult, especially as one condition can aggravate the other.
who should decide whether someone fits the profile for a home sleep apnea test?	at-home sleep apnea tests	at-home sleep apnea tests may be appropriate for diagnosing osa in some people, as long as a qualified sleep specialist interprets the results. however, polysomnography is the better option for people who are suspected of having another medical condition or sleep disorder in addition to osa. the process for at-home sleep apnea testing involves receiving a prescription from your doctor, conducting the test at home, and then sending your results to be interpreted by a sleep specialist. you should have a prescription from a doctor to obtain the home sleep apnea test. first, you need to schedule an appointment with your primary care physician or a sleep specialist, who will ask you about your symptoms and pre-screen you for obstructive sleep apnea.
what can alter a woman's sleep architecture?	do women need more sleep than men	hormones are another culprit behind women's greater need for sleep than men. our sleep-wake cycles are ruled by our hormones. these hormones affect when we feel tired, when we feel alert, when we feel hungry, and much more. women experience hormonal changes each month and over the course of their lifetimes, which impact their circadian rhythms and create a greater need for sleep. while research tells us that women need more sleep than men, it's also the case that women tend to sleep slightly longer than men - by just over 11 minutes. the bad news, however, is that women's sleep may be lower quality than men's, perhaps due to differences in how they spend their day.
what is progressive muscle relaxation?	relaxation exercises to help fall asleep	progressive muscle relaxation is based on the idea that it's hard to be tense when your muscles are relaxed. this exercise is performed by methodically tensing and relaxing 16 different muscle groups, one by one. first, write down all of the muscle groups or make an audio recording of yourself saying each one, giving about 45 seconds in between each group to allow yourself enough time to get through the process. the muscle groups are: hands, wrists and forearms, biceps, shoulders, forehead, around the eyes and nose, cheeks and jaw, around the mouth, back of the neck, front of the neck, chest, back, stomach, hips and buttocks, thighs, and lower legs.
what is memory foam also known as?	what are the differences between innerspring and memory foam mattresses	memory foam mattresses are made entirely of foam, with at least one memory foam comfort layer. they may have multiple layers of foam material, but they will not utilize any metal springs such as those found in innerspring and hybrid models. instead, the support cores of memory foam mattresses tend to be made up of high-density polyfoam. keep in mind that memory foam may be used in the comfort layers of hybrid and innerspring models - but it won't typically be marketed as a memory foam mattress unless it's an all-foam model. the term memory foam refers to viscoelastic polyurethane foam.
who is more likely to develop postpartum depression?	sleep deprivation and postpartum depression	in rare cases, some mothers go on to develop postpartum psychosis, and may have hallucinations, suicidal ideations, or thoughts of harming the baby. mothers with postpartum depression often have trouble bonding with their babies. as a consequence, postpartum depression can also have significant effects on the child's development, causing problems with mood, low self-esteem, and difficulty relating to peers. having postpartum depression after the first child raises the likelihood of having postpartum depression after subsequent pregnancies. postpartum depression is also more common in certain groups, such as first-time mothers, mothers of preterm babies, women with a prior history of depression, and those who lack a strong support network.
what can vary from person to person?	can you overdose on melatonin	however, there is currently no formal consensus on the optimal dosing regimen for this supplement. studies frequently use doses ranging from 0.1 to 10 milligrams, but 2 to 3 milligrams is often considered an appropriate amount to start. there are many challenges to determining the appropriate amount of melatonin for any one person to take. individual responses to this supplement can vary considerably due to factors that are not fully understood but can include age, gender, specific sleep issues, other health conditions, and timing of administration. in addition, not all melatonin supplements are created equal. differences in preparation can significantly alter melatonin's impact.
who is rls more common in?	how does insomnia affect women	women with sleeping problems are less likely to be referred to specialized sleep clinics where tests for osa are normally conducted. this may reflect underlying gender bias in how women's symptoms are evaluated. because untreated osa can be a major source of sleep disruption, underdiagnosis may contribute to ongoing sleeping problems in some women. restless leg syndrome (rls) is a condition in which a person has a strong urge to move their limbs, especially their legs, when lying down and is commonly associated with sleep difficulties. though the exact cause is unknown, rls is more common in women than men, which at least in part may be due to higher rates of rls during pregnancy.
what can reduce the half-life of caffeine?	caffeines connection to sleep problems	the effects of caffeine are measured by its half-life, which typically ranges from 4-6 hours. the half-life means the time that your body has metabolized, or processed through, half the caffeine you consumed. as a result, the six-hour half-life of a caffeinated beverage you consume in the afternoon could keep you up at night. some factors can slow or speed up the metabolism of caffeine. nicotine use can reduce the half-life of caffeine by up to 50%, so frequent smokers process through caffeine much quicker, with a half-life as short as two hours. by contrast, pregnant women experience slower caffeine metabolism.
what can help children sleep better?	sleeps impact on youth athletics and physical development	kids in this age group are still developing the physical skills they need to play organized sports. at this age, some children may begin to drop their daily nap. like teens and adults, however, young children who are especially active may benefit from additional sleep. bedtime routines can help preschool-aged kids fall asleep more easily. children who follow a regular bedtime routine are more likely to consistently sleep better. routines have also shown to improve kids' and parents' moods, lower household stress levels, and lead to better learning outcomes. to help your preschooler get more sleep, consider implementing a 30-40 minute bedtime routine that combines physical contact like cuddling, language-based activities like storytelling or singing, and hygiene activities like brushing teeth or bathing.
who can the arousing effects of caffeine benefit?	how to go to sleep earlier	to reinforce the idea that the bedroom is for sleeping, avoid staying in bed awake for longer than 20 minutes. if you have not fallen asleep by this time, go to another room and do a quiet activity in low light until you feel sleepy again. the average american consumes about 165 milligrams of caffeine every day, or just under two 8-ounce cups of coffee. sugary drinks may also contain a significant percentage of caffeine. while caffeine can be an effective and inexpensive productivity tool, it can also cause sleep problems. caffeine promotes arousal by affecting levels of adenosine, a substance that helps regulate sleep.
what are sleep deprived people less aware of?	the military and sleep	problematically, young people suffering from sleep deprivation are prone to underestimating how much it affects their performance, and often think they're performing better than they are. indeed, only 16% of soldiers believe their performance is affected by lack of sleep. this tendency - combined with symptoms like impaired cognitive performance, reaction time, and judgment - can threaten a soldier's personal safety, the success of their mission, and national security. sleep deprivation can negatively impact a soldier's ability to assess the threat level in a situation, coordinate with their squad, and engage optimally in combat activity. they may experience lapses in memory or attention, cause an accident, or get injured.
what does an eeg measure?	sleep study: definition and what to expect	for this test, you will go to a sleep lab that is set up for overnight stays-usually in a hospital or sleep center. while you sleep, an eeg monitors your sleep stages and the cycles of rem and nonrem or nrem sleep you go through during the night, to identify possible disruptions in the pattern of your sleep. a sleep study will also measure things such as eye movements, oxygen levels in your blood (through a sensor-there are no needles involved), heart and breathing rates, snoring, and body movements. the data from your sleep study will usually be taken by a technologist, and later evaluated by your doctor.
what can alzheimer's disease be affected by?	genetic mutation may decide how much sleep we need	fu says, though it's not yet clear which. in this most recent study, the researchers studied mice with the short-sleep genetic makeup and saw how the faster rate of repair during sleep meant the subjects were resistant to nerve cell damage or cell death. they also saw fewer deposits of tau protein and amyloid plaques, which are hallmarks of alzheimer's disease. the authors say that by understanding how this short-sleeper genetic mutation affects sleep quality, we could find ways to improve sleep for other people. they favor this strategy of using knowledge to aid prevention rather than trying to develop treatments for conditions like alzheimer's disease after symptoms have already started to appear.
what can cause problems with sleep regulation?	what is a normal sleeping heart rate	sleep problems can have negative impacts on your heart and cardiovascular health, increasing your heart rate and contributing to higher blood pressure. disorders such as sleep apnea, periodic limb movements, or shift work disorder that interfere with sleep have been linked to a higher chance of developing cardiovascular disease. several factors can influence heart rate during sleep. with the possible exception of rem sleep, your heart rate should typically be lower during sleep than when you are awake. high heart rates are connected with taking longer to fall asleep and experiencing lower sleep quality, as well as an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
what does lack of sleep cause athletes to do?	how sleep affects athletic performance	a lack of sleep also increases irritability and risk for anxiety and depression. physically, a lack of sleep increases the risk for many medical concerns, including type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney disease, and stroke. while quality sleep has positive effects specifically on athletic performance, a lack of sleep is detrimental to performance. evidence shows that more sleep, or extended sleep, can benefit athletes, their recovery, and their performance. recommendations for athletes range between seven and nine hours nightly. elite athletes are encouraged to get at least nine hours of sleep nightly and to treat sleep with as much importance as athletic training and diet.
how is pressure buildup measured?	pressure relief	pressure relief is one of the first things we evaluate when analyzing a new mattress. our team members test the bed by lying on it and measuring pressure buildup using a pressure mapping pad. these assessments help us gauge how the mattress performs compared to other models of the same type. to test how a mattress feels, our in-house testers lie on the bed in different positions and record their perceptions. each tester starts by lying on their side for 3 minutes, leaving enough time for pressure points to form. then, they get off the bed and note any pressure points they experienced as well as their overall impressions.
what conditions can inflame the sinuses?	why do people snore	the size and shape of certain structures can constrict the airway and lead to snoring. for example, people are more likely to snore if they have a deviated septum, which is when the wall between nostrils is bent or skewed to one side. additionally, growths in the nasal passages called polyps, having a small jaw, and having an enlarged tongue or tonsils can contribute to snoring. treatment approaches for people who have one of these anatomical causes of snoring include surgery and dental devices. both methods aim to increase the flow of air in and out of the airway during sleep.
what is periodic limb movement disorder characterized by?	periodic limb movements disorder: causes, symptoms, & treatments	periodic limb movement disorder (plmd) is a rare sleep disorder characterized by periodic, repetitive movements of the legs and feet during sleep. in some cases, the disorder also affects the arms. if you have plmd or sleep with someone who has plmd, you may recognize these movements as brief muscle twitches, jerking movements, or an upward flexing of the feet. plmd can disrupt sleep and co-occur with other sleep disorders, including restless legs syndrome and narcolepsy. periodic limb movement disorder, referred to as plmd, is a sleep disorder that affects approximately 4% to 11% of the population.
what is pink noise?	what is white noise	because white noise spans multiple bands of sound, it is sometimes referred to as a broadband noise. anecdotally, people often liken white noise to the static that comes from an untuned radio or television. researchers have studied the effect of white noise on humans for many years, finding evidence it can reduce crying in infants, improve work performance, and potentially help counteract symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd). multiple studies have also examined how white noise may affect human sleep. like white noise, pink noise is a broadband sound containing components from across the sound spectrum.
what is talalay latex?	mattress support cores	talalay latex is often softer and typically reserved for comfort layers in mattresses. knowing the indentation load deflection (ild) of the latex can help shoppers determine how the material will feel. a higher ild indicates that more pressure is required to compress the latex, meaning the mattress feels subjectively firmer. latex support core pros and cons. though airbeds are a slightly less common option, they have a unique feel and allow users to customize them on a nightly basis. these beds use air chambers as their support core. using an air pump, sleepers can add air to increase the firmness, or release air to make the surface softer.
what can jet lag do?	melatonin and sleep	jet lag can occur when a person travels rapidly across multiple time zones, such as on an intercontinental flight, because their body's internal clock becomes misaligned with the local day-night cycle. evidence from small research studies points to melatonin supplements as potentially helping to reset the sleep-wake cycle and improve sleep in people with jet lag. shift workers - people who work during the night - often struggle with sleep difficulties related to a misaligned circadian rhythm. studies of melatonin in shift workers have had inconclusive results, although some people report a benefit. there is debate about whether melatonin is beneficial in otherwise healthy adults who have insomnia, a persistent condition marked by trouble falling asleep or staying asleep.
what can the results of polysomnography be affected by?	how sleep latency impacts the quality of your sleep	sleep latency is also recorded during polysomnography. sleep latency measurement begins when the technician turns out the lights in the sleeper's room. the measurement stops when an electroencephalograph (eeg) reading shows that the sleeper's brain waves indicate sleep rather than wakefulness. a person's sleep habits in the days leading up to polysomnography or a multiple sleep latency test are important. if someone sleeps much more or less than normal, or if they sleep at unusual times, their sleep latency could be shortened or lengthened as a result. for this reason, practitioners often ask sleepers to keep a sleep diary and record their sleep habits in the days leading up to the sleep study.
what substances are sometimes used to treat rls?	marijuana for sleep: benefits and risks	marijuana appears to improve sleep in certain cases. for people with certain conditions such as chronic pain, post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd), and multiple sclerosis, marijuana may help them fall asleep faster, wake up less during the night, and enjoy better sleep quality overall. a recent study also found that marijuana effectively relieves symptoms for people with restless legs syndrome (rls). many people use marijuana to self-treat insomnia, anxiety, and pain. among these users, the effectiveness of marijuana for sleep is more ambivalent, though a study conducted on individuals with insomnia found that many participants reported relief from their symptoms when using cannabis.
when does a clear preference for side sleeping emerge?	how to buy a mattress online	while these recommendations are usually accurate for most sleepers, there is some variability due to differences in personal preferences. sleeping position: your preferred sleep position can help you determine an appropriate firmness level. side sleepers concentrate their weight onto one side of the body, creating significant pressure points at the hips and shoulders. for this reason, they tend to prefer slightly softer, more contouring mattresses to redistribute their weight. back sleepers usually favor medium to medium firm models with moderate contouring, while stomach sleepers often prefer a firmer mattress to support their alignment. body weight determines how much pressure you place on your mattress.
what factors does the optimal plan to avoid jet lag depend on?	jet lag: symptoms: causes, and how to cope	in addition to changing your bedtime, this approach often involves carefully timed melatonin and light exposure to proactively alter your circadian rhythm. while this approach may be beneficial in some cases, it may not be practical depending on your daily schedule, and professional, family, and social obligations. the optimal plan to avoid jet lag depends on many factors including the direction of your flight, the number of time zones crossed, how long you will remain at your destination, and your schedule and obligations during your trip. taking these factors into account, you can create a personalized plan to reduce jet lag.
who is sleep apnea more common in?	mental health and sleep	osa occurs more frequently in people with psychiatric conditions and may detract from their physical health and heighten their risk of serious mental distress. although further research is needed to identify the diverse connections between sleep and mental health, the existing evidence demonstrates that there is a multifaceted relationship that can be influenced by numerous factors in any specific person's case. the way that sleep and mental health are intertwined becomes even more apparent by reviewing what is known about how sleep is tied to a number of specific mental health conditions and neurodevelopmental disorders. it is estimated that over 300 million people worldwide have depression, a type of mood disorder marked by feelings of sadness or hopelessness.
why are mattresses more complicated and expensive to ship than most other items?	how to ship a mattress	are you planning a cross-country move? or wanting to send a spare mattress to a friend or family member? if so, you might be thinking about the costs and logistics of shipping a mattress. because of their size and weight, mattresses are more complicated and expensive to ship than most other items; however, that doesn't mean that it can't be done. with the right preparation and process, you can safely get your mattress from point a to point b. this guide walks you through that process so that you can understand what it may cost to ship a mattress, whether it's actually worth having it shipped, specific steps that you should follow to get your mattress ready to send, and alternatives to mattress shipping.
what leads to a 25% reduction in severity of osa?	how weight affects sleep apnea	weight loss of just 10-15% can reduce the severity of osa by 50% in moderately obese patients. unfortunately, while weight loss can provide meaningful improvements in osa, it usually does not lead to a complete cure, and many sleep apnea patients need additional therapies. with several options for losing weight, many osa patients want to know which one is best for sleep apnea. doctors usually prescribe dietary and exercise interventions as a first-line treatment for obesity. obese patients who are unlikely or unable to achieve adequate weight loss through behavior modifications may consider pharmacological or surgical interventions.
when should you see a doctor as soon as possible?	how to safely sleep with a concussion	if you have concussion symptoms after experiencing an injury, see a doctor as soon as possible. seeking medical attention is especially important if you develop a stiff neck, problems with consciousness, a worsening headache that will not go away, repeated vomiting, problems with speech or movement, weakness, confusion, seizures, double vision, unusual behavior, or fluids leaking from the ears or nose. you should also talk to your doctor if your symptoms get worse, or if you do not feel completely recovered after a week following the concussion. most people see a major improvement in symptoms within ten days to a month, though it is not uncommon to have lingering symptoms that last for months.
when can sleep paralysis happen?	what is narcolepsy	common hallucinations include seeing or hearing a person nearby, feeling pressure on the chest, or having an out-of-body experience. hallucinations are usually visual but can also involve other senses. sleep paralysis is a temporary inability to move or speak that occurs when waking up or falling asleep. about 20% of all people experience at least one episode of sleep paralysis during their lives, and sleep paralysis occurs in an even higher percentage of people with narcolepsy. paralysis is usually brief, lasting just a few seconds or minutes. during this time, a person is fully aware of their surroundings and is able to hear but cannot open their eyes, speak, or move their limbs.
what tends to cause greater motion transfer?	motion isolation	there are trade-offs with motion isolation that may also deter people who sleep with a partner. mattresses that emphasize motion isolation can be less bouncy and more difficult to move on, which can be inconvenient for combination sleepers or people with mobility concerns. the ability to absorb movement can also make a mattress less suitable for sex. some mattress materials are inherently better at isolating motion than others. while support core design is one of the most important factors when considering motion isolation, the use of motion-isolating materials in the transitional and comfort layers can improve the mattress' overall performance and help alleviate the effect of a motion-transferring core.
what does the mattress glossary help translate?	mattress glossary	mattress shopping can be overwhelming, and the plethora of special vocabulary doesn't make it any easier. for many shoppers, unique and unfamiliar mattress vocabulary only adds to the confusion. that's why we've developed a comprehensive mattress glossary to help translate the industry's common terminology related to mattress construction, performance, sizing, and policies. if you're like most people, you've probably never thought much about how mattresses are made. but without the right background knowledge, you'll have a hard time distinguishing between features and understanding what makes each model distinct. therefore, it's especially important to understand mattress construction terms.
what does sleeping unihemispherically enable?	how do different animals sleep	dolphins, eared seals, and manatees are all marine mammals who sleep unihemispherically. during unihemispheric sleep, one side of the brain sleeps while the other side stays awake, enabling these animals to enjoy the restorative benefits of sleep while still being on the lookout for potential threats. birds also sleep unihemispherically, with one side of the brain asleep while the other stays awake. as they sleep, only the eye associated with the sleeping hemisphere of their brain is closed. unihemispheric sleep allows birds to protect themselves from predators. for example, mallard ducks can sleep in a row.
what can a sleep diary be an important tool in?	sleep diary: how and why you should keep one	regardless of the name, all of these are patient-recorded methods of tracking information about sleep. a sleep diary is an important tool for evaluating a person's sleep. doctors often request a sleep diary, but some people may use one on their own accord. by keeping a record of sleep, the diary makes it possible to calculate total sleep time. a sleep record also helps people identify sleep disruptions and other factors that can influence sleep quality. identifying details about habits that affect sleep can show patterns that help explain sleeping problems. for healthcare providers, the concrete entries in a sleep diary are often more reliable and usable than a general recollection about sleep habits.
what mattress size will studio apartments allow?	full vs. queen mattresses	studio apartments or smaller bedrooms may only allow room for a full size mattress, whereas larger bedrooms may comfortably accommodate a queen. it's a good idea to measure your space before purchasing so you can see if the bed will fit. the differences between a full and a queen may seem minimal, but each mattress size has clear benefits and drawbacks depending on what you need from your bed. consider the size and number of sleepers, the size of your space, and personal factors such as your sleeping style.
what is sleep paralysis?	what are the symptoms of narcolepsy	people may fall asleep at any moment, with brief naps ranging from just a few seconds to several minutes. they often wake from these short naps feeling much more alert and awake. during lapses in attention or brief periods of sleep, people with narcolepsy may perform activities with no conscious awareness and little memory of them afterward. while performing habitual activities, like eating, talking or typing, they may fall asleep and automatically continue the activity. usually, their performance declines, with a common example being writing that becomes an illegible scribble during brief sleep attacks. sleep paralysis is a temporary loss of voluntary muscle control while waking up or falling asleep.
what are leptin and ghrelin?	benefits of sleep on mental and physical health	sleep deprivation directly affects the levels of two hormones, ghrelin and leptin, that are closely tied to hunger and weight. levels of ghrelin - the so-called hunger hormone - increase, stimulating your appetite. the counterpart to ghrelin is leptin, a hormone that the body uses to tell your brain that you're full. leptin levels decrease when you're tired, making it harder to stop eating even once you're satiated. sleep can also help if you're looking to gain weight. studies show that sleep impacts your body's ability to repair and gain muscle. researchers in 2019 found that sleep deprivation improved weight lifters' endurance and weight capacity when training. since physical activity also positively impacts sleep quality, it's a win-win situation!
what are hallmarks of alzheimer's disease?	how can dementia affect sleep	for example, one of the first alzheimer's disease symptoms in the brain is the accumulation of a protein called amyloid-beta, which eventually forms clumps called amyloid plaques. animal studies and a small study in people have shown sleep deprivation to increase the levels of amyloid-beta in the brain. at the same time, alzheimer's patients with amyloid plaques have been shown to have worse sleep quality than alzheimer's patients who do not have amyloid plaques. additionally, sleep is known to be critical for our cognitive functioning and memory formation. observational studies have shown that sleep issues are associated with cognitive decline and dementia.
what can high-carbohydrate meals impair?	nutrition and sleep: diets effect on sleep	it has been well established that high-carbohydrate meals often can make you feel drowsy. high-carbohydrate meals can also impair your sleep quality. in fact, high carbohydrate intake has been shown to increase the number of awakenings at night and reduce the amount of deep sleep you get. it is not a surprise that frequent consumption of energy drinks and sugar-sweetened beverages is associated with poor sleep quality. many different types of diets can offer this kind of nutritional balance, and some have been evaluated more closely for how they affect sleep. for example, the mediterranean diet, which is plant-based while incorporating lean meats and high-fiber foods, has been found to improve heart health and sleep quality.
what are women more likely to experience?	do women need more sleep than men	these mothers may suffer disrupted sleep, and compensate by taking naps during the day. women are also more likely to be informal caregivers, which causes stress and affects sleep as well. of course, every situation is different, and more research must be done to see how increasing numbers of women in the workforce and changing family dynamics affect sleep for all genders. women are more likely to have insomnia, which often goes hand-in-hand with anxiety, depression, and chronic diseases. for some women, insomnia may be a secondary effect of anxiety and depression as these mood disorders are also more commonly diagnosed in women.
what can wearing socks to bed help?	sleeping with socks on: can it help you sleep	next time you are picking out what to wear to bed, consider adding socks. many people anecdotally claim that sleeping in socks helps them sleep better and scientific research suggests they might be onto something. learn about how socks may impact sleep and which socks to choose if you want to try this potentially sleep-boosting method. research suggests that wearing socks to bed can help people not only fall asleep faster, but sleep longer and wake up fewer times throughout the night. one study found that young men wearing socks fell asleep 7.5 minutes faster, slept 32 minutes longer, and woke up 7.5 times less often than those not wearing socks.
what can prompt you to wake up during the night?	tips for waking up less frequently at night	if you wake up in the middle of the night, consider leaving your bed to do something else for 20 minutes before laying back down to sleep. to help regulate your sleep-wake cycle, try to spend time in the sunlight during the day and avoid too much bright light in the evening. waking up in the middle of the night once in a while is not generally a cause for concern. however, experiencing frequent sleep interruptions and not feeling well rested each morning could indicate a sleep disorder or another health condition. speak with a health care provider if you are experiencing sleep problems. they can work with you to address any health issues and determine a treatment plan.
what can actigraphy be used in combination with?	how is actigraphy used to evaluate sleep	actigraphy is designed to provide minimal interference to day-to-day life, so you can go about your normal routine. these parameters help medical professionals identify any peculiarities in your sleep schedule. actigraphy may be used on its own, or in combination with another sleep test such as a sleep log or an overnight sleep test. actigraphy relies on interpreting movements, so it can only be used in the context of certain sleep disorders. researchers have also considered using actigraphy to diagnose periodic limb movement disorder, in which the limbs move during sleep. however, actigraphy on its own generally does not produce accurate results, and it is not recommended for this purpose.
what should be done to most mattresses?	how long should a mattress last	traditional innerspring beds generally have the shortest expected lifespan, at approximately five and a half to six and a half years. sleep position & body weight: the position you sleep in, as well as your body weight, will affect how quickly your mattress wears out. heavier sleepers may find that their mattresses begin to sag prematurely, while side-sleepers may find excessive sagging around the hips and shoulders. care routine: like most things in life, if you take care of your mattress, it will last longer. proper mattress care includes routine cleaning, utilizing protective covers, and following manufacturer care guidelines.
what does white noise refer to?	the best sounds for sleep	white noise is technically defined as sound that contains equal levels of every frequency. this even distribution is thought to help reduce the brain's reactivity to spikes in volume. however, in practice, people use a wide variety of steady sounds to block out interruptions. these include the sound of air conditioners, vacuum cleaners, and other machines, in addition to specialized white noise sound machines. preliminary research suggests that playing pink noise during sleep may optimize brain waves to improve sleep quality. whereas white noise includes all the frequencies at equal volumes, pink noise assigns lower volumes to higher frequencies.
what should body positioning during sleep be chosen based on?	how to buy a mattress online	while these recommendations are usually accurate for most sleepers, there is some variability due to differences in personal preferences. sleeping position: your preferred sleep position can help you determine an appropriate firmness level. side sleepers concentrate their weight onto one side of the body, creating significant pressure points at the hips and shoulders. for this reason, they tend to prefer slightly softer, more contouring mattresses to redistribute their weight. back sleepers usually favor medium to medium firm models with moderate contouring, while stomach sleepers often prefer a firmer mattress to support their alignment. body weight determines how much pressure you place on your mattress.
why do experts recommend people with osa avoid using weighted blankets?	weighted blanket reviews	for older children, weighted blankets appear to be safe, so long as they are of an appropriate weight. always check with your pediatrician before purchasing a weighted blanket for a child. certain groups should check with their doctor before using a weighted blanket. those with sleep apnea should likely avoid the use of weighted blankets, as they can further restrict breathing. those with chronic respiratory or circulatory conditions should also typically avoid using weighted blankets.
what is a common treatment for anxiety disorders?	anxiety and sleep	cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt) is a common treatment for anxiety disorders. it is a type of talk therapy that works to reorient negative thinking, and it has had success in decreasing anxiety. studies have found that cbt can often reduce anxiety even in people who have insomnia. addressing anxiety can pave the way for better sleep, but severe cases of insomnia may persist after cbt for anxiety. cbt for insomnia (cbt-i) may be a useful next step in these cases. several different types of medications are approved to treat anxiety disorders including anti-anxiety drugs, antidepressants, and beta-blockers.
what can sleep doctors educate patients on?	the connection between diet, exercise, and sleep	a doctor, with knowledge about someone's unique health history, can help to prioritize lifestyle changes. doctors can also refer their patients to specialists, like nutritionists, dieticians, physical therapists, and sleep specialists for more tailored advice. while most people know that diet and exercise are two important ways to improve their health, sleep is often overlooked. sleep hygiene, which involves recommendations that promote quality sleep, are a good place to start if you're looking to improve your sleep.
what does memory foam absorb?	what is memory foam	when memory foam is used as a mattress material, this quality helps the mattress cushion the body evenly, and creates the slow contouring feeling as the mattress adapts to the impact of your body and re-forms around your curves. memory foam also returns relatively slowly to its original shape when force is removed-on average, around 5-10 seconds. during this recovery period, energy from the impact is absorbed and dissipated. this time lag, a phenomenon known as hysteresis, also helps cushion sleepers, because it removes some of the pressure (or, impact energy) produced by the prone body. another important part of how memory foam works is that its viscosity decreases with temperature.
what changes as we grow older?	tips for falling back asleep after waking up at night	many health issues cause or exacerbate insomnia. nighttime awakenings associated with a health issue are often due to a symptom of that issue. for example, coughing might wake up a person with a lung disease, while heartburn might wake up a person with gerd. addressing the underlying health issue or sleep disorder is an important step toward regaining better sleep. research shows that as people grow older, they tend to spend less time in deep sleep and more time in light sleep. since it is easier to wake up from light sleep and more difficult to wake up from deep sleep, spending more time in light sleep might explain why older adults also wake up more during the night.
what does caffeine use cause?	how to go to sleep earlier	to reinforce the idea that the bedroom is for sleeping, avoid staying in bed awake for longer than 20 minutes. if you have not fallen asleep by this time, go to another room and do a quiet activity in low light until you feel sleepy again. the average american consumes about 165 milligrams of caffeine every day, or just under two 8-ounce cups of coffee. sugary drinks may also contain a significant percentage of caffeine. while caffeine can be an effective and inexpensive productivity tool, it can also cause sleep problems. caffeine promotes arousal by affecting levels of adenosine, a substance that helps regulate sleep.
what can contribute to symptoms of anxiety?	is cannabidiol a safe and effective sleep aid	however, not everyone experiences the same sleep benefits with cbd use, and different doses might lead to different effects. research suggests that low doses of cbd are stimulating, while high doses of cbd are sedating. discrepancies in experience can also be attributed to the method of cbd administration and dose. additional research is needed to deepen our understanding of cbd as an intervention for sleep disorders. while not a sleep disorder itself, anxiety can contribute to poor quality sleep, insufficient sleep, and sleep disorders. because cbd calms the nervous system, early research indicates that cbd can be used to treat anxiety-related disorders.
what plays a key role in a child's physical and mental health?	children and sleep	sleep is an essential building block for your child's mental and physical health. but if you're finding it impossible to help your toddler sleep, you're not alone. the american academy of pediatrics estimates that sleep problems affect 25 to 50 percent of children and 40 percent of adolescents. understanding their sleep needs is the first step towards providing better sleep for your children. through a combination of sleep hygiene, age-appropriate routines, and close attention to any sleep disorders, you can help your child get the rest they need to grow up strong and healthy. sleep plays a crucial role in the development of young minds.
what is a benefit of stomach sleeping?	what are the best positions for sleeping	the stomach is the least popular sleep position. research suggests we spend less than 10% of our night sleeping in this position. stomach sleeping does have some benefits, however. namely, the stomach sleeping position can help relieve snoring, by opening up your airway. however, your ribs do have to work against gravity in order to breathe in this position, which may force you to use more energy and thereby make your sleep less restful. the stomach sleeping position comes with several drawbacks and is not recommended for most people. the stomach position provides the least back support of all sleeping positions and increases pressure on the spine, sometimes causing pain upon waking up.
what do people with insomnia have difficulty doing?	how long it should take to fall asleep	if you take longer than 20 minutes to fall asleep, you might be experiencing insomnia. insomnia is characterized by trouble falling asleep, trouble staying asleep, or waking up earlier than you would like and being unable to fall back asleep. people with insomnia often also experience excessive daytime sleepiness. experts suggest getting out of bed and engaging in other activity if you are not nearing sleep after lying down for 20 minutes. factors other than insomnia may cause you to have trouble falling asleep in a timely fashion. for example, ingesting caffeine even 6 hours before bedtime can disrupt your ability to sleep.
what does napping reduce?	how long should you nap	in fact, researchers have identified a nap paradox, in which many studies find naps provide benefits, while others find napping is associated with illnesses. studies show napping might be particularly helpful for people who cannot sleep during regular nighttime hours, such as those who work rotating schedules or at night. a nap taken before working overnight or during a night shift can reduce sleepiness and improve mental ability and work performance. naps may also reduce the risk of car crashes due to drowsy driving. the ideal nap length depends on an individual's unique situation, as well as what they want from the nap.
what are many cases of rls associated with?	restless legs syndrome: symptoms and causes	it is different from rls in that these movements are not accompanied by uncomfortable sensations and because they occur during sleep, patients are often not aware of them. however, plmd-associated movements can cause a person to wake up and therefore can compound sleep issues in patients who also have rls. although most people with rls have plmd, many with plmd do not have rls. sometimes, rls is associated with other medical conditions, such as late-stage kidney disease, iron deficiency, neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, or parkinson's disease. rls can also occur temporarily during pregnancy, with around 20% of women developing rls during the third trimester.
what reduces total number of leg movements per hour?	sleeping while pregnant: second trimester	a pregnancy body pillow or wedge pillow may help you to adopt a more comfortable position. likewise, smaller pillows tucked under the waist and belly may relieve pressure, and a pillow between the knees can help improve the alignment of the hips and spine. it's best not to take medications such as sleeping pills during your pregnancy unless prescribed by your doctor, but you may consider other sleep aids. mineral supplements and light stretching before bed may help reduce leg cramps. some pregnant women use herbal remedies, although you should always consult with your doctor first.
what can keep a person up at night?	interrupted sleep: causes, symptoms, and prevention	up to 85% of women with menopause experience hot flashes. when a hot flash occurs during the night, the sudden increase in body temperature and adrenaline wakes you up, making it tough to fall back asleep. various medications include sleep problems as a symptom. these medications include some stimulants, antidepressants, over-the-counter cold medicines and decongestants, and some medications for high blood pressure, heart disease, allergies, asthma, adhd, and parkinson's. even something as innocent as your bedroom environment can be the culprit behind your disrupted sleep. bedrooms that are too hot, bright, or noisy can keep waking you up at night.
what does postprandial sleepiness refer to?	why do i get sleepy after eating	learning more about postprandial sleepiness can make it easier to understand why people get tired after a meal, foods that may cause drowsiness, and ways to reduce sleepiness after eating. postprandial sleepiness, also called postprandial somnolence, refers to the feeling of sleepiness after consuming food. it is sometimes known as the post-lunch dip or referred to more informally as a food coma. researchers are not exactly sure why it is common for people to get sleepy after eating. studies suggest that multiple factors may influence energy levels after a meal, including changes in hormones, blood flow, brain chemicals, inflammation, and the body's internal clock.
what are treatments for orthopnea focused on?	orthopnea: definition, causes, and treatments	if you haven't yet been diagnosed with a related underlying condition, your doctor may order additional tests, such as a chest x-ray, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, pulmonary function test, or blood test, to evaluate for potential causes. treatments for orthopnea are focused on minimizing symptoms and treating the underlying cause. specific treatments for orthopnea include pillow positioning, supplemental oxygen, and medication. depending on the severity of the underlying condition, doctors may prescribe lifestyle changes, medications, medical devices, or surgery. propping yourself up with a pillow can help you breathe better by reducing pressure on the lungs and heart.
what is type 2 diabetes marked by?	diabetes and sleep: sleep disturbances & coping	diabetes affects more than 30 million people in the u.s. and is the seventh leading cause of death. the most common form of diabetes, type 2 diabetes, is a chronic disease that develops due to insulin resistance. insulin is a hormone that helps transfer glucose from the blood to the muscles, fat, and liver, and other cells, where it can be used for energy. insulin resistance occurs when the body has trouble producing insulin, or when the insulin fails to transfer glucose into these cells. this leads to a build-up of glucose in the blood, otherwise known as high blood sugar, which is the hallmark symptom of diabetes.
what does light exposure suppress?	how to stop hitting the snooze button	the enticing aroma might lure you out of bed. also, if you are taking a midday nap, having some caffeine before you lie down may reduce sleep inertia after you wake up. light exposure suppresses melatonin, the sleep hormone. as a result, allowing light into your room when you have first woken up might help you feel more alert and awake. as soon as your alarm goes off, it may help to open the curtains or shades to let sunlight in. or, if you have smart lights, you can schedule them to turn on when your alarm sounds.

what is celliant fiber designed to do?	what is celliant fiber and how is it used in mattresses	by reflecting that energy back into the body, celliant is designed to improve cellular oxygenation and local circulation for a more restful, rejuvenating sleep. for the best results, celliant must remain in close proximity to the skin. celliant fiber is not used as a primary material, so mattress manufacturers typically weave it into the cover or top comfort layer material. any mattress type can include celliant, though foam and hybrid beds tend to incorporate it more often. sheets, pillowcases, and blankets can also include the specialty fiber. celliant fiber is designed to increase circulation and cellular oxygenation, improve strength and stamina, and promote more restful sleep - all of which can aid recovery from intense physical activity and provide relief from aches and pains.
what did sigmund freud propose?	dream analysis and interpretation	perhaps you have woken up after a memorable dream and wondered what it meant. for years, neurologists and psychologists have studied the meaning of dreams. there is not yet a conclusive answer as to why we dream or what our dreams mean, if they mean anything. however, experts have posed many theories. psychoanalyst sigmund freud believed dreams were the door to the unconscious. he found that dreams were composed of a combination of personal experiences, external stimuli, internal stimuli, and mental processes during sleep. essentially, freud felt that dreams concealed and distorted the unconscious meaning of the dream.
what did white noise affect in adults?	pink noise: can it help you sleep	whereas the frequencies of pink noise decrease by 3 decibels per octave, white noise contains all the audible frequencies at equal volumes. as a result, pink noise is perceived as being softer and white noise sounds higher-pitched, like a humming air conditioner. like pink noise, white noise includes all the audible frequencies. because it contains all the sounds at the same volume, white noise has potential benefits for blocking out annoying sounds, treating tinnitus, inducing relaxation, and helping with sleep problems. white noise has been shown to reduce babies' crying, help them sleep longer, and reduce pain during infant vaccination.
what is the comfort layer?	mattress support cores	the type of materials used in the comfort system directly relates to how firm the mattress will feel. the comfort layers should conform closely enough to relieve pressure points, without causing users to sink in too far and feel swallowed by the mattress. transitional layers are typically made of slightly firmer materials than the comfort system, such as high-density polyfoam, latex, or microcoils. the goal of a transitional layer is to provide a deeper cradle and prevent sleepers from making contact with the hard support core. this layer is usually thinner, between 1 and 3 inches.
when do animals hibernate?	what animals sleep standing up	most animals seem to have a biological need for sleep. the way they sleep, however, differs across species. for example, some animals hibernate in the winter, which involves a prolonged period of alternating between longer bouts of sleep and a state that falls between sleep and wakefulness, and others don't. many animals, like dogs, cats, and humans, sleep lying down. research has found that others, like certain species of migratory birds and fur seals, can put half their brain to sleep while the other half keeps them flying or floating. and, there are even animals that perform the impressive feat of sleeping while standing up.
what is the ideal bedroom temperature?	sleep environment	the ideal room temperature for sleeping is between 60 and 67 degrees fahrenheit. temperatures that are colder or warmer than this ideal can disrupt the cycles of internal temperature regulation that help govern our sleep. depending on your personal rhythms and the temperature of your room, this disruption can manifest as difficulty falling or staying asleep. while cold temperatures appear to disrupt sleep more than warm temperatures, heat also contributes significantly to poor sleep and cannot be addressed by adding another blanket. air conditioning is the most popular and effective way to solve a too-warm bedroom, as most people find alternatives like electric fans to be inadequate.
why is it hard to know which natural sleep aids are safest?	natural sleep aids: a competitive review of melatonin, valerian, and others	however, since the fda does not review if supplements are safe or effective, finding the most effective natural sleep aid can be difficult. learning about the evidence supporting different supplements, as well as their potential effects and side effects, can make it easier to decide which natural sleep aid might be best for you. however, it is important to consult your doctor before starting any new supplement. natural does not always mean safe for everyone. many supplements should not be taken by people who are allergic to the product, have certain conditions, or take certain drugs.
what may women with postpartum depression feel?	sleep deprivation and postpartum depression	in fact, fatigue is one of the criteria that doctors normally consider when diagnosing depression. knowing how to identify postpartum depression is important, as it's a serious condition that may not go away on its own without proper treatment. a better understanding of the relation between sleep deprivation and postpartum depression can help you recognize when to seek help from a doctor. women with postpartum depression may feel overwhelmingly anxious, hopeless, and unable to get out of bed. these feelings last for longer than two weeks and are more severe than just the baby blues. they can also interfere with the ability to carry out day-to-day life.
who may have reduced sleep spindle activity?	what are sleep spindles	psychiatric disorders: sleep spindle disturbances and reduced spindle activity are associated with psychiatric symptoms. these changes have been found in people with both anxiety disorders and schizophrenia. in schizophrenia, reduced spindle activity is believed to have a genetic component, and it may explain difficulties with memory and learning. studies of children and adolescents with social anxiety disorder have found that heightened reactivity to negative stimuli goes hand-in-hand with reduced fast sleep spindles. reduced sleep spindle activity is associated with early-onset depression. people who experience a stroke may have reduced sleep spindle activity. whether or not a person who had a stroke experiences this sleep change depends on the type and location of the damage.
what is the average lifespan of a mattress?	how to dispose of a mattress	as the cornerstone of your sleep system, your mattress helps create a comfortable environment so you can sleep soundly every night, so it's important to make sure it's in working order. although a bed is a major purchase, mattresses don't last forever. after years of regular use, all mattresses will eventually wear down and need replacing. the average lifespan of a typical mattress is 7 to 10 years. however, there are many factors that can affect your mattress' longevity. how you use and care for your mattress has a large impact on its lifespan. additionally, inadequate support and rough use by pets or children may prematurely wear out your bed.
what is pressure relief determined by?	pressure relief	pressure relief is highly dependent on your body type and sleeping position, so no single mattress is optimal for every sleeper. however, certain models tend to perform better in this area, and you can narrow down your options by understanding what you need in a mattress. we'll take an in-depth look at how pressure relief works and explain what you need to know to find the best mattress for you. mattresses that evenly disperse body weight and prevent sore spots are said to relieve pressure. pressure relief is strongly tied to mattress firmness, and most sleepers find models with some contouring ideal.
what does the support core contain?	mattress support cores	the support core is a crucial part of any mattress. it reinforces the bed and prevents the sleeper from sinking too deeply into the surface of the mattress. the support core also influences other important performance aspects such as temperature neutrality, edge support, and durability. support cores can be constructed using a wide variety of materials, the most common of which include foam, latex, coils, and air or water chambers. we'll examine the materials and construction of the most common support core types to help you find the right option for your needs. located in the base of the mattress, the support core is designed to provide spinal support and stabilize the mattress.
what is impaired swallowing and excessive drooling common with?	how to stop drooling in your sleep	excessive salivation and drooling are side effects of certain medications, including some antibiotics, antipsychotic drugs, and medications used to treat alzheimer's. if you take prescription medications and drool at night, your medication may be a potential cause of the drooling. check the list of potential side effects of your medication for drooling. if drooling is listed, do not stop taking your medication. instead, speak with your doctor first about your concerns, and ask if they can recommend an alternative medication that will not cause you to drool as much. your nervous system stimulates your salivary glands, which may explain why impaired swallowing and excessive drooling are common with neurodegenerative disorders.

what is middle-ground between a twin and a queen?	full vs. queen mattresses	a full mattress - also known as a double - measures 54 inches wide by 75 inches long, whereas a queen measures 60 inches wide by 80 inches long. a full size mattress is the same length as a twin mattress, while the length of a queen is comparable to a twin xl or a king mattress. in terms of width, a full is just wide enough to accommodate two sleepers, though most partners tend to prefer a queen. because of their larger size, queen size mattresses are slightly more expensive than full size models. while both queen and full sizes cost more than twin mattresses, they have lower price-points than king sizes.
what affects nighttime sleep for babies?	what should babies wear to sleep	dressing your baby for sleep may seem simple compared to trying to get them to sleep through the night. however, there are several important considerations to take into account. a baby should sleep in clothing intended for infant sleep in order to stay warm at night, since babies are not supposed to sleep with blankets or bedding apart from tight-fitted bed sheets. for example, babies often sleep in sleep sacks and onesies. the american academy of pediatrics (aap) recommends dressing babies in clothes similar to what an adult would feel comfortable wearing in the same temperature.
what are sleep spindles are a hallmark of?	what are sleep spindles	along with another wave pattern called k-complexes, sleep spindles are considered a hallmark of stage 2 nrem sleep. sleep spindles occur not just in humans but also in many other mammals, and experts have debated the purpose of sleep spindles for years. scientists believe sleep spindles occur as a result of activity in the thalamus, the thalamic reticular nucleus, and the neocortex. unusual sleep spindle activity is related to multiple different physical and mental health issues. scientists are interested in understanding how sleep spindles relate to different conditions, in order to better diagnose and predict the onset of these diseases.
when does travel fatigue go away?	how to sleep well when traveling	travel fatigue can cause headaches, feelings of being disoriented, and make it difficult to get enough sleep. some research suggests that travel-related fatigue can even exacerbate certain medical problems. some people may be more susceptible to travel fatigue than others. research suggests that people with a rigid sleep schedule may experience more severe travel fatigue than those with more flexible sleep habits. traveling often requires being open to new experiences. this can be one of the most exciting parts of being far from home, but it can also make it more difficult to relax. many people find it harder to fall asleep in an unfamiliar place, like a hotel room, a vacation rental, or a friend or family member's house.
what can be a stand-alone symptom of narcolepsy?	how is narcolepsy diagnosed	low levels are indicative of narcolepsy type 1, which involves the loss of neurons in the brain that produce hypocretin. along with low hypocretin levels, almost everyone with nt1 carries a variation in a gene called hla-dqb1. human leukocyte antigen (hla) testing can look for this variation, but, because it exists in many people without narcolepsy, it alone is not capable of providing a diagnosis. though not routine, other medical tests, such as blood work or imaging tests, may be recommended by the doctor if they suspect and want to test for another condition that may be causing your symptoms.
what does fibromyalgia primarily cause?	fibromyalgia and sleep: sleep disturbances & coping	fibromyalgia, also known as fibromyalgia syndrome, is a chronic disorder characterized by widespread feelings of pain and stiffness in the muscles and joints. roughly 4 million people in the u.s. although the cause of this condition is not known, patients can treat and manage their symptoms through medication, therapy, and lifestyle changes. sleep problems are a common symptom of fibromyalgia. for some people with the disorder, sleep disturbances exacerbate their symptoms and lead them into a vicious cycle of pain and poor sleep. practicing good sleep hygiene and adopting healthy sleep habits can alleviate fibromyalgia-related sleep issues.

what must a mattress provide to be comfortable?	mattress firmness	no one firmness level performs optimally for all sleepers. factors such as weight, body type, and preferred sleep position all influence what is comfortable and supportive for you. additionally, firmness is not the only performance factor to consider when choosing a mattress. other variables, such as durability, temperature neutrality, and responsiveness, can also influence overall comfort. since there is no universally accepted measurement for mattress firmness, each manufacturer may use its own system. however, a 10-point scale is common. our system can give you a clearer idea of how a mattress may feel and how the firmness compares to other models.
what is swaddling?	when can a baby sleep with a blanket	including any soft items in the crib, such as a blanket, pillow, crib bumper, or stuffed animal, can also put your baby at an increased risk of experiencing sudden infant death syndrome (sids), the most common cause of infant death. swaddling refers to the practice of snugly wrapping a baby in a blanket for warmth and security, leaving only the child's head exposed. swaddling can be safer than giving your baby a blanket in the right circumstances, such as when the infant has not yet tried to roll over. this practice can allow the baby to feel comforted without direct parental contact and promote healthy sleep.
when does the first cycle of rem sleep begin?	what is paradoxical sleep	adults spend the majority of the night, approximately 75% to 80% of total sleep time, in non-rem sleep. during these three stages of sleep, brain waves, breathing, and heartbeat progressively slow down. in the deepest stage of non-rem sleep, muscles are relaxed and eye movements virtually stop. the first cycle of rem sleep begins around 60 to 90 minutes after falling asleep. in rem sleep, brain activity increases to levels similar to those seen during waking hours. at the same time, most muscles enter a state of atonia, which means that they are temporarily paralyzed.
how did insomnia symptoms compare between black and white participants during the covid-19 pandemic?	study examines insomnias impact on black adults during covid-19	participants self-evaluated their insomnia symptoms during the april 2020 re-evaluation. they also reported experiences with racial discrimination and the covid-19 pandemic's impact on their routines, income, employment, access to food, medical care and mental treatment, access to social support, familial stress, and diagnoses and severity of covid-19 in their family and social networks. researchers noted that while no racial differences in insomnia were detected acutely following insomnia treatment after the initial clinical study in 2017, black participants reported more severe insomnia symptoms during the covid-19 pandemic when compared to white participants. these results came after adjusting for factors such as pre-covid insomnia severity, treatment condition, sex, and household income in the re-evaluation.
what is coronasomnia?	sleep guidelines and help during the covid-19 pandemic	millions of people suffered from insomnia before covid-19, and unfortunately, the pandemic has created a host of new challenges for them and for people who previously had no difficulty sleeping. coronasomnia is a new term coined to refer to sleep challenges related to the pandemic. over the past two years, doctors and sleep scientists have documented a wide range of ways that covid-19 has changed and disrupted sleep patterns. around 40% of people have experienced sleeping problems, and studies have detected notable increases in insomnia symptoms in adults and children and adolescents. some people report getting more total sleep during the pandemic, but sleep quality has typically suffered.
how does caffeine promote arousal?	how to go to sleep earlier	to reinforce the idea that the bedroom is for sleeping, avoid staying in bed awake for longer than 20 minutes. if you have not fallen asleep by this time, go to another room and do a quiet activity in low light until you feel sleepy again. the average american consumes about 165 milligrams of caffeine every day, or just under two 8-ounce cups of coffee. sugary drinks may also contain a significant percentage of caffeine. while caffeine can be an effective and inexpensive productivity tool, it can also cause sleep problems. caffeine promotes arousal by affecting levels of adenosine, a substance that helps regulate sleep.
what is the main purpose of a support core?	mattress support cores	the support core is a crucial part of any mattress. it reinforces the bed and prevents the sleeper from sinking too deeply into the surface of the mattress. the support core also influences other important performance aspects such as temperature neutrality, edge support, and durability. support cores can be constructed using a wide variety of materials, the most common of which include foam, latex, coils, and air or water chambers. we'll examine the materials and construction of the most common support core types to help you find the right option for your needs. located in the base of the mattress, the support core is designed to provide spinal support and stabilize the mattress.
what negative effects occur during the transition from dst to standard time in november?	daylight saving time - how time change affects sleep	the beginning of dst in march is associated with many negative outcomes and risk factors that some experts advocate for abandoning the system altogether in favor of a year-round time. they argue a permanent standard time is more in line with human circadian rhythms, and that this schedule would carry benefits for public health and safety. on the side of the argument, people in favor of dst argue that at least 70 countries around the world observe dst as it decreases energy consumption, reduces costs, and protects the environment. there is also evidence that crime rates decrease with the use of dst due to the lack of dark hours.
what sleep disorder can cause snoring?	sleep disorders - common types, symptoms, treatments	learn more about how these medical devices can make a big difference in nighttime comfort for people with breathing issues. snoring can be a sore subject for bed partners, roommates, and family members. sleep apnea is a relatively common disorder in which people experience disrupted breathing while they are sleeping. narcolepsy is a sleep disorder that makes people feel excessively tired during the day despite getting an adequate amount of rest the previous night. this can lead to the irrepressible urge to sleep, culminating in sleep attacks that typically last for a few minutes.
what is the key first step for people who want to document or interpret dreams?	dreams: why we dream & how they affect sleep	a doctor can review these symptoms to identify the potential causes and treatments of their sleeping problem. for people who want to document or interpret dreams, remembering them is a key first step. the ability to recall dreams can be different for every person and may vary based on age. remind yourself that dream recall is a priority. in the lead-up to bedtime, tell yourself that you will remember your dreams, and repeat this mantra before going to sleep. while this alone can't ensure that you will recall your dreams, it can encourage you to remember to take the time to reflect on dreams before starting your day.
what is cortisol?	coronasomnia: definition, symptoms, and solutions	these effects can last up to 2 years after the event. stress increases your levels of cortisol, a hormone that operates inversely to melatonin, the sleep hormone. cortisol rises in the early morning to energize your body for the day, and lowers in the evening, as melatonin production begins to prepare you for sleep. when your cortisol levels remain elevated, melatonin production gets disrupted, as does the restfulness of your sleep. the pandemic has introduced many stresses to our lives, but being stuck at home is a stressor all its own. this stress increases if you're sharing your home with a limited number of people, you're dealing with increased work and parenting obligations, and there's less newness in your life to keep you engaged.
what may lead to a rem latency that is shorter or longer than usual?	how sleep latency impacts the quality of your sleep	sometimes, the body compensates for this effect by spending a higher percentage of time in rem sleep during the next sleep period. this phenomenon is called rem rebound. sleep latency also affects rem latency, another measurement related to sleep stages. rem latency measures how long after it takes a person to reach their first rem sleep stage after turning the lights out. therefore, the rem latency measure includes the sleep latency measure. the longer it takes a person to fall asleep, the longer it takes them to reach their first rem sleep stage. a rem latency that is shorter or longer than usual may be caused by medication, sleep deprivation, or sleep disorders.
what are the common culprits that can trigger a headache when you wake up?	morning headaches: causes and treatments	if you find yourself frequently waking up with headaches in the morning, you are not alone. approximately 1 out of every 13 people experiences morning headaches. these headaches typically affect women more than men and are most frequent in people between the ages of 45 and 64. a number of sleep or health disorders, as well as personal habits, can trigger a headache when you wake up. sleep apnea, migraine, and lack of sleep are common culprits. however, teeth grinding, alcohol use, and certain medications can also cause you to wake up with a headache.
what is delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (dswpd)?	non-24 hour sleep-wake disorder: symptoms & diagnosis	since the symptoms of n24swd overlap with other circadian rhythm disorders, it is sometimes overlooked or misdiagnosed. the delay in sleep onset may make n24swd appear to be delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (dswpd), a disorder that causes a tendency to stay up late into the night and have difficulty waking in the morning. the variation in sleep times associated with n24swd may also be confused with irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder (idiopathic hypersomnia). in this disorder, people wake and sleep with no apparent pattern, which makes it difficult for them to adhere to consistent schedules and obligations. although these disorders are similar, n24swd is different from both in that it features a delay in the sleep-wake cycle that progresses consistently over time until it cycles all the way around the clock.
how may exercise at night impact the proportion of restorative deep sleep?	exercise and insomnia: can physical activity combat insomnia	researchers have a few theories why this might be the case. while researchers are still working to understand exactly how physical activity affects sleep, they've found that moderate aerobic exercise is the most effective at relieving insomnia. specifically, moderate aerobic exercise increases the amount of time you spend in deep sleep. deep sleep is the stage where your body restores and replenishes itself, healing your muscles and tissues to prepare for more exercise. multiple studies have found that regular exercise correlates with better sleep. across age groups, individuals who have a regular exercise routine are less likely to have insomnia and sleep issues.
what bodily function is faulty in rem sleep behavior disorder?	ms and sleep disturbances: insomnia, nocturia, & coping	rem sleep behavior disorder: as we dream during rapid eye movement (rem) sleep, our bodies typically experience atonia, or paralyzation of the muscles. in rem sleep behavior disorder, this function is faulty, leading patients to act out their dreams, sometimes in violent or dangerous ways. rem sleep behavior disorder seems to occur more often in ms patients with damage to the brainstem. if you suspect that you or a loved one may have a sleep disorder, talk to your healthcare professional. they can conduct a polysomnography, or sleep test, during which they will look for signs of a sleep disorder and work with you to develop an appropriate treatment plan if a disorder is found.
when is drowsy driving most likely to occur?	driving while drowsy can be as dangerous as driving while drunk	even mild and short-term sleep deprivation can cause dangerous impairments to driving ability. one study by the aaa foundation for traffic safety found that sleeping between six and seven hours a night doubled the risk of being involved in a crash, while getting less than five hours of sleep doubled it again. drowsy driving is most likely to occur between midnight and 6 am or in the late afternoon, when most people are naturally sleepier. driving on a monotonous road or driving alone may increase the likelihood of a crash. drowsy driving is commonly found in people who have slept less than six hours; those who suffer from sleep apnea or other sleep disorders; young drivers; individuals who have consumed alcohol or who are taking medications; shift workers; and professional drivers.
what factors can influence the results of a multiple sleep latency test (mslt)?	how sleep latency impacts the quality of your sleep	the mslt involves giving a sleeper opportunities to take four or five daytime naps about two hours apart. researchers measure how long it takes the person to fall asleep. if the person does not fall asleep within 20 minutes, that nap is canceled and the sleep latency is recorded as 20 minutes. if the person does fall asleep, testers record brain activity for the next 15 minutes, with a special focus on whether participants reach rem stage during their naps. multiple factors can influence results of a multiple sleep latency test, including recent sleep deprivation, medication use, and activity level.
how long does an average newborn baby sleep for over each 24-hour period?	how much sleep do babies and kids need	for this reason, the american association of sleep medicine (aasm) and american academy of pediatrics (aap) have chosen not to list a recommended amount of sleep for babies under 4 months old. guidelines from the nsf state that infants (4-11 months old) should get between 12 and 15 hours of sleep per day. aasm and aap guidelines, which recommend 12-16 total hours, closely track those of the nsf. it is normal for infants to sleep for 3-4 hours during the day. babies spend more than half of their time sleeping because this is a period of substantial growth.
what do researchers often do to better identify health disparities?	sleep disorders and race: whats the connection - sleep foundation	to better identify health disparities, researchers often employ broad categories of race and ethnicity, such as those found in the u.s. although these categories are imperfect and can represent groups as far more homogenous than they really are, they have served as a starting point for examining the differences in sleep and other health problems. an important component of future research in this field is the concept of intersectionality, which recognizes that impacts of inequality can be distinct for people not just based on their race or ethnicity but also their gender, sexual orientation, age, socioeconomic status, and other factors.
what are dreams?	what are dreams	researchers estimate people dream for approximately two hours every night, even if they forget most of those dreams. there are still many mysteries surrounding the purpose of dreams and why the brain creates stories during sleep. it is difficult to study something that takes place while asleep and relies on people remembering what they experienced upon waking. however, new research has advanced the scientific understanding of dreaming. dreams are the mental thoughts, feelings, imagery, and sensations people experience during sleep. they primarily arise as a result of brain activity in the cerebral cortex, the outer layer of the brain that is responsible for higher-order thought processes.
what should you check before bleaching sheets?	how to get blood out of sheets	be sure to check the product label before bleaching. some colored sheets can also be bleached, but you'll need to read the product label carefully. if you do decide to use bleach, be sure to spot-test by applying a small amount of diluted bleach to a less-visible area of the fabric. before putting sheets back on your bed, look closely to ensure nothing soaked through to the mattress itself. if need be, learn how to clean your mattress in our guide. if the blood has already dried and created a stain, the process for removing it will be similar, but a bit more time-consuming.
how can hyperthyroidism cause difficulty sleeping?	could your thyroid be causing sleep problems	lastly, iodine intake can play a role in thyroid health. the thyroid gland uses iodine to produce hormones, so an inadequate or excessive amount of iodine in your diet can contribute to thyroid disease. thyroid imbalances have been linked to sleep problems. hyperthyroidism (overactive) can cause difficulty sleeping due to arousals from nervousness or irritability, as well as muscle weakness and constant feelings of tiredness. an overactive thyroid may also lead to night sweats and frequent urges to urinate, both of which can disrupt sleep. people with hypothyroidism (underactive), on the other hand, often experience trouble tolerating cold at night and joint or muscle pain that disrupts sleep.
what effects on children can frequent naps lead to?	how much sleep do babies and kids need	some older children may still be inclined to nap and can benefit from doing so. in a study in china, where it is often more culturally appropriate to nap, children in grades 4-6 who took frequent naps after lunch showed signs of better behavior, academic achievement, and overall happiness. the existing research about napping and optimal timing of sleep episodes is inconclusive and acknowledges that what's best for one child can change over time and may not be what's best for another child of the same age. for this reason, parents, teachers, and child care workers may be able to best encourage optimal sleep for kids by being flexible and understanding about naps.
what are the two main characteristics of insomnia?	reclaiming our sleep and controlling stress amid covid-19	not long after a vaccine gave us a sense of hope, covid-19 variants emerged. all the while, we may have experienced loss or separation from loved ones, unpredictable financial security, and a 24-hour news cycle reflecting worldwide instability. our brains need to somehow trust that the world is safe to be able to fall into that vulnerable state of sleep. the pandemic continued prompting us to adjust our routines, and with that, it also uprooted our sleep. the inability to sleep despite the opportunity for it, along with daytime impairments caused by such sleep loss, are two main characteristics of insomnia.
what type of mattresses are coil support cores mainly found in?	mattress coil types	this process utilizes repeated heating and cooling to improve the coil's resiliency and enable it to keep regaining its original shape despite prolonged use. coil-based mattresses tend to be responsive and fairly durable. as the coils leave room for airflow, they also sleep cooler than all-foam mattresses. coil-based mattresses may be more or less supportive depending on factors such as the coil type, gauge, total coil count, and overall mattress design. the four primary types of coils used in mattress support cores include bonnell coils, offset coils, continuous wire coils, and pocketed coils. some mattresses also use microcoils, nanocoils, and minicoils in the comfort or transitional layers.
what is the estimated proportion of adults that suffer from insomnia?	sleep disorders and race: whats the connection - sleep foundation	a multifaceted view of health disparities enables a clearer understanding of these problems and their potential solutions. when looking at top-line data, it's clear that sleeping problems are a major concern in the united states. it's estimated that around 30% of adults suffer from insomnia, and an even higher percentage experience occasional short sleep of less than 7 hours per night. researchers who have started to dig deeper into this big-picture data, though, have found that, although sleeping problems can affect people of all races, there are strong indications that they have a disproportionate impact on racial and ethnic minorities.
what are some of the ways to support a baby's sleep?	giving your newborn a pacifier for sleep: benefits and risks	however, babies who practiced sucking on the mother's emptied breast instead of a pacifier were more likely to breastfeed exclusively when they were discharged from the hospital. pacifiers provide newborns with several benefits, particularly during their first 6 months. pacifiers can calm babies when they are feeling fussy or anxious. they may also relieve pain and ease their crying during medical procedures. research suggests non-nutritive sucking, such as on a pacifier, may support healthy baby sleep. using a pacifier during sleep also appears to significantly lower a baby's risk of sudden infant death syndrome (sids), although researchers still do not understand the specific reason why, or even if the lower risk can be attributed solely to the use of a pacifier.
when does a woman's risk of sleep-disordered breathing increase?	how can women get better sleep	as a pregnancy progresses, these symptoms often intensify and become more frequent. nearly 8 in 10 pregnant women have trouble sleeping, according to data collected from a women and sleep survey. the average pregnant woman wakes up three to five times per night during their third trimester. the risk of restless legs syndrome also increases from 8% in the first trimester to 22% in the third. up to 25% of pregnant women report frequent snoring, which may be a symptom of sleep apnea, another condition that worsens sleep quality and leads to sleep disruptions. hormone levels change again during menopause, when a woman's risk of sleep-disordered breathing increases by 21% to 41% compared with premenopausal women.
when should you consider delaying the transition from a crib to a bed for a toddler?	when should you switch to a toddler bed	if you are expecting another child, you may need to move your toddler to a bed so your newborn can use the crib. if possible, start transitioning your toddler to the new bed at least a few months before the baby arrives. this gives your toddler time to adjust to their new bed without feeling jealous or displaced by their new younger sibling. switching from a crib to a bed is a big change for toddlers, and toddlers do not always adjust to changes easily. if your toddler is in the middle of potty training, or another big transition like starting daycare or a family move, consider delaying the transition to a bed for a little while longer.
what can contribute significantly to the overall feel and performance of a mattress?	body weight	certain materials tend to create a more stable surface for heavier sleepers. for example, models with coil cores often provide more substantial support than all-foam options. additionally, zoning may also be beneficial. this construction technique incorporates added support in areas where it's needed most, like the midsection. adding a topper or placing your mattress on a sturdier foundation can adjust the feel to better accommodate your changing weight. if you've lost weight and your mattress is now too firm, incorporating a plush topper can add cushioning and cradling. an exceptionally firm topper may also be helpful if you've gained weight and your mattress is too soft. using the mattress with a more stable foundation or a bunkie board can also help firm up the feel and add support, but you should always make sure the base is compatible with your mattress model.
what is the best way to prevent drowsy driving accidents?	driving while drowsy can be as dangerous as driving while drunk	the best way to prevent drowsy driving accidents is to get enough sleep. you should also avoid drinking alcohol or taking any medications that could interfere with alertness. take regular breaks, and when you notice yourself getting sleepy, pull over and take a 20-minute nap in a safe place. caffeine, opening the window, and turning up the radio are only short-term fixes and may leave you vulnerable to dangerous microsleeps.
what can interfere with sleep in people with covid-19?	sleep guidelines and help during the covid-19 pandemic	but the consequences have spread far and wide, posing diverse and significant barriers to sleep. covid-19 is the disease caused by infection with the sars-cov-2 coronavirus. research has shown that people with covid-19 frequently have sleeping problems. symptoms like cough and fever as well as the use of some medications can interfere with sleep. sleep disruptions have been seen in people with severe covid-19 as well as non-hospitalized patients. additionally, many people with long covid, which involves persistent health effects months after infection, describe having lasting sleep difficulties. social distancing, school closures, quarantines, and working-from-home all bring profound changes to normal routines for people of all ages and walks of life.
how can music promote sleep?	music to help you sleep	one study found that music can improve sleep quality within three weeks. listening to music likely improves sleep for more than one reason. for example, music can reduce stress and pain, both of which interfere with sleep. it may also promote sleep directly, by affecting your physiology. music impacts your sympathetic nervous system and hormone production. listening to music can lower levels of cortisol, a hormone associated with stress, while increasing oxytocin, a hormone associated with positive feelings. many people use music to help themselves feel better and distract themselves from negative or stressful thoughts.
what proportion of people suffering from depression report experiencing at least one symptom of insomnia?	benefits of sleep on mental and physical health	getting a good night's sleep helps everyone feel refreshed and ready for the day ahead, but people who suffer from depression may experience an even greater benefit. depression is a mental health disorder that affects over 300 million people a year worldwide. 80% of people suffering from depression report experiencing at least one symptom of insomnia, and the struggle to sleep worsens with age. research shows that treating sleep disturbances alongside depression helps reduce the overall impact of depression's symptoms. in a 2016 study, using cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt) to address sleep/wake behaviors improved the quality of sleep in test participants.
what should you think about if you want to replace or upgrade your bed?	when should you replace your mattress	of course, this is a general guideline and not a one-size-fits-all solution. there are various factors that influence when you should replace your mattress. essentially, you should replace your bed if it's no longer helping you get restful sleep. there's no clear-cut way to know for sure whether it's time for a new bed - but generally speaking, if you're thinking about a new bed, it's likely worthwhile to make the investment sooner rather than later. if you're thinking of replacing your mattress with a model that better suits your needs, you'll want to consider your sleep position, body weight, and other personal sleep preferences.
what are some of the products that can help you change your sleep position?	does mouth taping stop snoring	if you want to reduce snoring, you might consider training yourself to sleep on your side instead of taping your mouth. decades of research demonstrate that both people with and without obstructive sleep apnea snore less when they side sleep instead of back sleep. to make switching sleep positions more comfortable, you may want to consider purchasing a new mattress and pillow. the ideal bed setup promotes spinal alignment and reduces pressure points as you lie in your most common sleep position. nasal strips provide another option for snoring reduction. nasal strips are adhesive devices placed on the nose to expand the nasal passage and encourage nose breathing.
what is the purpose of a wind-down routine?	coronasomnia: definition, symptoms, and solutions	start by improving your sleep hygiene, establishing daytime and nighttime routines, and taking efforts to manage your stress. sleep hygiene is a term for the habits you have surrounding sleep. just as dental hygiene focuses on flossing and brushing your teeth, sleep hygiene focuses on healthy habits that promote better sleep. routines provide our brains with cues for when to eat, work, feel alert, and feel tired. establishing a daily routine and following it provides a sense of normalcy that can reduce stress. routines also provide clear time markers in a work-from-home lifestyle that can feel monotonous at times.
what are the recommendations from the world health organization regarding breastfeeding?	how much sleep do babies and kids need	there is some debate about how and whether the method of feeding affects a baby's sleep. while some research has found more nighttime awakenings in babies who are breastfed, other studies have found little difference between sleep patterns of breastfed and formula-fed babies. overall, because of documented health benefits apart from sleep, the aap recommends exclusively breastfeeding for six months and then continuing with complementary breastfeeding for a year or more. although not firmly established, there is some evidence that babies who are breastfed may have better sleep during their preschool years. parents who have concerns about their baby's sleep should start by speaking with a pediatrician.
how long do most humans dream for each night?	how long are dreams	for centuries, dreams have been a source of fascination. dreams can evoke deep emotions like wonder, joy, or confusion, and at times they can spark inspiration. although dream science has significantly advanced within the past couple of decades, there is still much to uncover about why we dream. fortunately, experts have started to unravel essential details that shed light on how dreams work. people have multiple dreams throughout the night. sleep in humans consists of four sleep stages: rapid eye movement (rem) sleep, and three non-rapid eye movement (nrem) sleep stages. dreams can happen in any sleep stage.
what are nightmares?	what causes nightmares theories & tips	nightmares are dreams that contain distressing themes of fear, guilt, and anxiety. although nightmares and bad dreams may seem like the same thing, only nightmares cause the sleeper to wake up out of sleep. it's common to wake up from a nightmare remembering details of the dream and still feeling distressed. having occasional nightmares is common. around 85% of adults report having at least one nightmare in the last year. frequent nightmares are less common, and only 4 to 10% of people report having one or more nightmares each week. nightmares are more common in women, children, and people diagnosed with a range of mental health conditions.
how long do most newborn babies sleep for on average?	how much sleep do babies and kids need	for this reason, the american association of sleep medicine (aasm) and american academy of pediatrics (aap) have chosen not to list a recommended amount of sleep for babies under 4 months old. guidelines from the nsf state that infants (4-11 months old) should get between 12 and 15 hours of sleep per day. aasm and aap guidelines, which recommend 12-16 total hours, closely track those of the nsf. it is normal for infants to sleep for 3-4 hours during the day. babies spend more than half of their time sleeping because this is a period of substantial growth.
what type of therapy do sleep psychologists most often use to help reduce unhelpful thoughts about sleep and increase sleep-supporting behaviors?	finding a sleep specialist in your area	sleep psychologists study sleep through a behavioral, psychological, and physiological lens. sleep psychologists most often use cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt) to help reduce unhelpful thoughts about sleep and increase sleep-supporting behaviors. cbt has been shown to effectively reduce insomnia in clinical trials. sleep psychiatrists may also use behavioral intervention tools, such as cbt, as well as prescribe psychiatric medication to help you sleep better. generally, sleep psychiatrists prescribe medication only after cbt or other behavioral interventions have failed. a quick online search should help you locate a sleep psychologist or psychiatrist near you. as physicians who work exclusively with the mouth and throat, dentists are also often overlooked when people consider a sleep specialist.
what type of sleeper is a king pillow often a good fit for?	pillow sizes	a king pillow measures 20 by 36 inches, making it the largest of the four common pillow sizes. a king pillow is often a good fit for sleepers who move around a lot and those who just prefer more surface area. two king pillows fit well on a king or california king bed, and the extra length comes in handy when propped up against a headboard and used as a backrest. at 26 by 26 inches, the euro pillow is a square-shaped design that can be used for hip and knee support, as a backrest when sitting up in bed, or simply for decoration.
what stage of sleep do the most vivid dreams occur during?	what happens when you sleep: the science of sleep	it's easiest to be awoken during these first two stages. in stage 3, also known as deep sleep, the body is in recovery mode, slowing down even further. at the same time, overall brain activity slows and shows a tell-tale pattern of pulses of activity that are believed to help prevent unwanted awakenings. the fourth stage is rem sleep. during rem periods, brain activity shoots back up to levels similar to when you're awake - which explains why rem is associated with the most intense dreams. while breathing and heart rate increase during rem sleep, most muscles are paralyzed, which keeps us from acting out those vivid dreams.
how do mrna vaccines work?	covid-19 vaccine: how sleep increases immune response	in those studies, people taking the vaccines were significantly less likely to get infected, develop severe symptoms, require hospitalization, or die from covid-19. compared with placebo, the vaccines offered considerable protection with minimal side effects. the vaccines developed by pfizer and moderna are mrna vaccines. this type of vaccine utilizes a harmless, synthetic fragment of genetic material from the virus to train the immune system to recognize and attack the virus itself. the vaccine developed by janssen, a component of the company johnson & johnson, is a viral vector vaccine. it incorporates a genetic fragment of sars-cov-2 into a deactivated common cold virus.
what might contribute to discomfort while back sleeping?	how to train yourself to sleep on your back	your knees should be slightly bent and feel comfortable. once you have put a small pillow beneath your knees, check to make sure that your neck and spine feel comfortable and are in alignment. some people find that back sleeping increases discomfort in their lower back. placing a pillow under your lower back while you sleep might help. if the pillow is too large or thick, however, it may create even more discomfort. you may need to try a few different pillows to find what works best for you. if you are an active sleeper and are worried about rolling from your back onto your side or stomach soon after you fall asleep, there are measures you can take to help prevent this.
what type of pillow helps back sleepers keep their neck on the same plane as the spine?	is sleeping on the floor good for you	you may find you enjoy another sleep position entirely. whichever position you choose, you can use pillows to support the natural curvature of your spine and sleep comfortably. back sleepers may place a thin pillow beneath the lower back, and another pillow beneath the knees, to relieve pressure in the lower back. to support spinal alignment, head pillows should fill the space between the neck and the floor. a pillow with a medium loft, or thickness, often works best for back sleepers. side sleepers may place a pillow between the knees to relieve tension. an additional, thin pillow between the waist and the floor can also be comfortable.
what is the cause of obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (ohs)?	pickwickian syndrome: symptoms, causes, and treatments	symptoms seen in ohs can also be caused by medications, such as sedatives or illicit drugs. for this reason, doctors might ask about medications or give a urine drug test as part of their assessment when they observe ohs-like symptoms. according to experts, obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (ohs) stems from multiple complex processes in the body rather than a single, clear-cut cause. that said, obesity often plays a role in the disorder, usually by making breathing more difficult. when fat accumulates around a person's chest and abdomen, the amount of space available for the lungs to expand in is reduced.
how many hours of sleep per night constitutes sleep deprivation?	all-nighters: helpful or harmful	an all-nighter can pose even greater problems if it is a precursor to unhealthy sleep patterns. experts recommend having a consistent sleep schedule because it normalizes your sleep times and contributes to positive sleep hygiene. an all-nighter is an extreme break from your schedule and runs in contrast to this recommendation. however, one all-nighter does not necessarily mean a person will have sleep problems afterward. after one night of sleep deprivation, most people feel a strong urge to get back to sleeping normally, which often allows them to recover their prior sleep pattern. the immediate effects on your mind and body demonstrate that it's bad to pull an all-nighter.
what does sleep hygiene refer to?	sleeping with socks on: can it help you sleep	wearing socks to sleep comes with very few risks, other than discomfort for those that prefer the feeling of being barefoot. be sure to wear socks that are loose, and do not wear compression socks to bed unless directed by a doctor or other medical professional. any socks that are not too tight and feel comfortable are likely good socks for you to sleep in. one study found that when wearing wool sleepwear, people fell asleep about 14 minutes faster than they did when wearing cotton and 9 minutes faster than when wearing polyester. wool socks may provide a similar effect, but more research is needed. sleep hygiene refers to the collection of habits you engage in that promote sleep, including avoiding electronics before bed, reducing room temperature, and other activities that help you wind down. if wearing socks to bed at night seems to help you fall asleep faster or stay asleep longer, you may want to include putting on socks as part of your bedtime routine.
how does music improve sleep?	music to help you sleep	one study found that music can improve sleep quality within three weeks. listening to music likely improves sleep for more than one reason. for example, music can reduce stress and pain, both of which interfere with sleep. it may also promote sleep directly, by affecting your physiology. music impacts your sympathetic nervous system and hormone production. listening to music can lower levels of cortisol, a hormone associated with stress, while increasing oxytocin, a hormone associated with positive feelings. many people use music to help themselves feel better and distract themselves from negative or stressful thoughts.
what are some examples of adult adhd sleep problems?	adhd and sleep problems: how are they related	those with combined hyperactive-impulsive and inattentive adhd experience both poor sleep quality and a later bedtime. many adhd symptoms are similar to symptoms of sleep deprivation. among others, adult adhd sleep problems include forgetfulness and difficulty concentrating. in children, fatigue may present as being hyperactive and impulsive. sometimes it can be difficult to tell whether these issues are brought on by adhd or by a lack of sleep. this may lead to misdiagnoses or may allow sleep disorders to go undetected. experts therefore recommend screening patients for sleep problems before prescribing medication for adhd.
what conditions are people who consistently sleep for more than nine or 10 hours per night more likely to have?	how much sleep do you need	to track your current sleep habits, you can use a written sleep diary or a digital device like a fitness watch or smartphone app. however, keep in mind that these devices can overestimate total sleep time. daytime tiredness commonly indicates that a person needs more sleep. if you begin noticing you feel tired, moody, or weak, if you have trouble sustaining attention, or if you experience any of the other effects associated with sleep deprivation, you may need more sleep. people who consistently sleep for more than nine or 10 hours per night are more likely to have obesity or a mood disorder, though it is not clear whether long sleep is a cause or result of these conditions.
where is the internal clock located within the body?	what is circadian rhythm	animals, plants, and bacteria all use biological clocks to align and synchronize the rhythms that are required for survival. without biological clocks telling it when to sleep, wake, and eat, an organism would be more likely to face predators, starvation, and health problems. internal processes in individual biological clocks help establish a basic circadian rhythm. these clocks are also influenced by external cues and synchronized by a master clock in the brain. a part of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (scn) plays the role of master clock in humans. located in the brain's hypothalamus, the scn coordinates all of the biological clocks within an organism.
what is the normal resting heart rate?	what is a normal sleeping heart rate	your heart rate fluctuates throughout the day, based on activity levels and emotions. stress and exercise can raise heart rate, while sleeping can lower it. a normal heart rate while sleeping is often between 40 to 50 beats per minute (bpm), though there is variability between individuals. we discuss what is considered a normal sleeping heart rate for each age range, as well as share signs to look out for that may indicate an underlying condition. heart rate can vary during rest, exercise, and sleep. for most adults, a normal resting heart rate is considered to be between 60 to 100 bpm, though this range can vary and depends on multiple factors.
what disorder could be a manifestation of dysfunctional sleep?	what happens when you sleep: the science of sleep	this can cause too much brain activity, which in turn can leave you feeling irritable and may worsen mental health issues like anxiety and depression. sleep disorders can negatively affect what happens when you sleep. for example, restless leg syndrome or disrupted breathing from sleep apnea can cause frequent awakenings that interrupt the normal sleep cycle, reducing restorative sleep. circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders can lead to insufficient sleep or abnormal sleep architecture. hypersomnia is a condition marked by sleeping too much. people with hypersomnia often experience excessive daytime sleepiness and may find it hard to stay awake when they need to. studies indicate that hypersomnia is associated with changes in sleep architecture, such as a reduction in deep sleep and an increase in nrem sleep, which may affect overall sleep quality.
what are the options for mattresses that are compatible with adjustable beds?	sleep and bedroom safety for seniors	the sleeper can sit up with the push of a button, making adjustable beds a suitable option for individuals with limited upper body strength or certain health conditions. some adjustable bed frames can be paired with conventional mattresses. adjustable bed frames can damage some mattresses. if you plan to use your current mattress with a new frame, be sure the mattress can handle frequent bending and movement. some beds include health and safety features that can benefit older adults, including massage settings and under-bed lighting. couples may want to consider split frames, which allow sleepers to raise and lower each side of the bed independently.
how does sleep affect mood swings?	does lack of sleep cause acne	sleep can also affect mood and perception, including how a person perceives their skin and overall appearance. women who sleep well tend to be more satisfied with their appearance than women who do not sleep well. this satisfaction may be due in part to how they are perceived in the world. studies have demonstrated that someone who is sleep deprived is perceived as less attractive. as a result of sleep deprivation, they might have dark circles under their eyes, swollen eyelids, and a puffy face. there is also a correlation between appearing tired and appearing sad.
what does sleep allow humans to do?	the connection between animal and human sleep	do animals sleep? absolutely! like humans, nearly all animals need some form of rest or sleep. most animals have a natural circadian rhythm or internal biological 24-hour clock that regulates sleep and wakefulness. for humans, sleep is essential for overall health. among other things, sleep allows humans to recharge, consolidate memories, and repair the body. younger humans also need sleep to appropriately grow. experts hypothesize that animals need sleep for similar purposes because, even though sleeping makes animals vulnerable, they do it anyway. the benefits of sleep are likely greater than the risks. the amount of sleep animals need varies greatly across species.
who takes the data from a sleep study?	multiple sleep latency test: overview	it is important to follow your doctor's instructions carefully and let them know about any changes to your routine. one to two weeks before taking the mlst, your doctor might ask you to start recording your sleep times in a sleep diary, or wear a device called an actigraph to monitor your sleep-wake activity. if you are taking certain medications or supplements, they might ask you to stop taking them temporarily. generally, an mslt takes place the day after an overnight sleep study called polysomnography. the sleep study can uncover potential causes of excessive sleepiness, as well as provide context for mslt results.
what is a first step to addressing the causes of nightmares?	what causes nightmares theories & tips	it's unclear if the meal itself leads to nightmares or if there's something else that explains this relationship. understanding the cause of nightmares is an important step to reducing their frequency. most importantly, don't be afraid to ask for help if you're experiencing nightmares. it's important to talk to a health professional if nightmares are happening more than once a week or if they're affecting your mood and daytime activities. there are several treatments available for recurrent nightmares, so don't suffer in silence.
what does blue light interfere with?	best bedroom colors for sleep	while blue is a highly recommended bedroom wall color because it invokes calm and relaxation, exposure to blue light in the evening can negatively impact sleep. blue light is emitted from electronic devices such as tvs, computers, and cell phones. research shows that using these devices right before bedtime delays sleep onset. excess exposure to blue light at night can also increase sleepiness the next morning because it disrupts the circadian rhythm. colors with negative associations or stimulating physical effects are typically not recommended for primary bedroom colors. having excessive amounts of these colors in your bedroom can make winding down at the end of the day more difficult and delay or disrupt your sleep.
what can the edge support of a mattress be particularly important for?	edge support	additionally, edge support can play a role in the bed's overall longevity by limiting sagging and improving its overall structure. in general, if a model has sturdy edge support, you may not notice the trait. however, if a mattress has especially weak edges, it's hard to ignore. edge support affects all sleepers, but it matters more to some than others. a stable perimeter is often most essential for couples, since it impacts how much of the surface they can use. if a model has weak edges, sleepers may automatically gravitate towards the center of the bed to avoid the sensation that they might roll off.
when do most toddlers in general make the move from a crib to a bed?	when should you switch to a toddler bed	some kids are ready to make the switch as early as 18 months, while others feel more comfortable once they are 2 or 3 years old. the right time for your family can depend on a number of factors. approximately one-third of toddlers transition to a bed between the ages of 18 months and 2 years old, and another third transition between ages 2 and 2.5. in general, most toddlers make the move from a crib to a bed between the age of 18 months and 3 years old. this wide age range means there are a few factors to consider before making the change.
what is sleep hygiene?	alzheimers: managing sleep disturbances	in addition to treating any underlying sleep disorders that are contributing to disturbed sleep, practicing good sleep hygiene can help people with alzheimer's to sleep better. sleep hygiene means cultivating healthy sleep habits and maintaining an environment that promotes quality sleep. these approaches to sleep hygiene may be challenging to implement for some patients, but evidence suggests that such efforts can pay off. a study found that, compared to a control group, implementation of sleep hygiene practices, daily walks, and exposure to a lighting device resulted in a reduction in time awake at night and depression in alzheimer's patients and that these gains were sustained after six months.
what happens each time a person with osa experiences airway collapse and briefly stops breathing during sleep?	is sleep apnea connected to heart disease	the sympathetic nervous system triggers the body to gasp for air, which sometimes wakes a person out of sleep. the sympathetic nervous system also responds to a low level of oxygen by constricting blood vessels and increasing heart rate and blood pressure. as the pauses in breath continue throughout the night, repetitive changes in blood pressure may lead to hypertension or make existing hypertension worse. when a person with obstructive sleep apnea (osa) attempts to breathe, they inhale against a narrowed or closed upper airway. these unsuccessful, forced inhalations can cause substantial changes in pressure within the chest cavity.
how many hours of sleep should infants (4-11 months old) get according to the guidelines from the nsf?	sleep schedules for babies: 6-9 months	although sleep needs vary among children, the national sleep foundation provides guidelines for how many hours babies and toddlers should sleep during each 24-hour period. if you are concerned that your baby sleeps too much or too little, contact your pediatrician. expert guidelines outline how much babies should sleep during both day and night. for this reason, how much a baby should nap largely depends on how much they sleep at night. babies should nap as many hours as needed to get sufficient sleep in a 24-hour period. for example, guidelines recommend that 6-month-olds should sleep 12 to 16 hours a day, so if they sleep eight hours at night, they should nap around four to eight hours during the day.
what are the effects of sleeping on a dirty bed?	how often should you wash your sheets	since your bed is where you likely spend 7 to 9 hours every night, it's extremely important to make sure it's clean and comfortable. while it might be clear why your choice of sheets matters, it can be easy to overlook the significance of keeping those sheets clean. as you lie in bed, your sweat, dead skin cells, and body oils transfer to your bedding. if you don't regularly wash your sheets and blankets, these contaminants will build up, even if you don't notice. sleeping on dirty bedding can decrease your sleep quality and leave you waking up feeling tired and congested.
how will feeding additional solid food to children before bed affect their wakefulness during the night?	is breastfeeding or formula better for infants sleep	it's important to note that your baby's stomach capacity is very small and therefore cannot hold a large volume of milk and that babies under the age of 4 months should be given no food other than breast milk or formula. while there is some evidence to suggest that formula takes longer to digest than breastmilk, your baby will still require frequent feedings due to the small size of their stomach, regardless of what option you chose. while feeding your child more food before bed might reduce their hunger levels throughout the night, it doesn't seem to impact their sleep patterns.
what can sleep-related hypoventilation increase your risk of?	what is sleep-related hypoventilation	while some people exhibit hypoventilation as early as childhood, it's more common to develop due to obesity, an underlying medical disorder, or drug use. people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) are significantly more likely to have sleep-related hypoventilation. other underlying medical conditions that have been linked to sleep-related hypoventilation include obesity, lung and respiratory diseases, and neurological and musculoskeletal disorders. chronic use of certain medications or drugs may also lead to sleep-related hypoventilation. long-term use of narcotics, anesthetics, sedatives, opioids, muscle relaxants, and alcohol may all increase your risk for sleep-related hypoventilation. one study of individuals with chronic pain found that up to 50% of those on long-term opioid therapy also had hypoventilation.
what is oversleeping?	how much sleep is too much	oversleeping is variably defined as sleeping for more than eight to 10 hours a day. oversleeping has been linked to several serious health complications, although experts are careful to point out that oversleeping may be a cause rather than a result of these conditions. people who sleep for more than nine hours a night are more likely to receive a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes or heart disease. oversleeping is also linked to a higher overall mortality risk, although this correlation is likely due to the various causes of and conditions associated with oversleeping. oversleeping may increase the risk of developing depression for those who are genetically predisposed.
what are the effects of drowsiness after sleep deprivation?	the day after a sleepless night	drowsiness after sleep deprivation can put you at risk for accidents, impair your physical performance, and hurt your memory, even increasing the likelihood of developing false memories. if you occasionally experience a sleepless night due to insomnia or an external cause, you might wonder what you can do to better function the next day. although nothing can fully make up for a lack of sleep, there are certain actions you can take to help you stay up after a sleepless night and remain alert enough to get through work, school, or other tasks you have to do the next day.
how can sleep be used to cope with the stressors of a person's life?	coronasomnia: definition, symptoms, and solutions	your bed should only be used for sleep and sex. at night, follow a bedtime routine to help you unwind from the day. performing the same set of activities every night also signals to your brain that it's time to sleep. stop using your electronics at least 1 hour before bed, and turn down the lights. instead, enjoy a relaxing activity like reading a book or taking a bath. listen to something calming, like a guided meditation or gentle music. stress makes sleep difficult, pandemic or not. regular exercise, journaling, and taking a break from the news may help relieve stress and improve your sleep.
what is talalay latex typically reserved for in mattresses?	pressure relief	high-density polyfoam support cores help prevent sleepers from sinking too far into the mattress. some softer all-foam models fail to adequately support sleepers over 230 pounds, which may lead to excessive sinkage in weight-bearing areas with corresponding pressure buildup. latex mattresses tend to be durable and supportive. although they don't offer localized contouring, they can help reduce potential pressure points from improper spinal alignment by limiting sinkage. made with thick comfort systems over coil support cores, hybrid mattresses aim to leverage the advantages of multiple types of beds. hybrids usually provide average to above-average pressure relief depending on the composition of the comfort system.
how can you use a pillow to help you sleep on your back?	sleeping while pregnant: second trimester	a pregnancy body pillow or wedge pillow may help you to adopt a more comfortable position. likewise, smaller pillows tucked under the waist and belly may relieve pressure, and a pillow between the knees can help improve the alignment of the hips and spine. it's best not to take medications such as sleeping pills during your pregnancy unless prescribed by your doctor, but you may consider other sleep aids. mineral supplements and light stretching before bed may help reduce leg cramps. some pregnant women use herbal remedies, although you should always consult with your doctor first.
